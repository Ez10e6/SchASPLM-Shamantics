The tokenizer you are loading from './local_models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct' with an incorrect regex pattern: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503/discussions/84#69121093e8b480e709447d5e. This will lead to incorrect tokenization. You should set the `fix_mistral_regex=True` flag when loading this tokenizer to fix this issue.

The tokenizer you are loading from './local_models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct' with an incorrect regex pattern: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503/discussions/84#69121093e8b480e709447d5e. This will lead to incorrect tokenization. You should set the `fix_mistral_regex=True` flag when loading this tokenizer to fix this issue.

To correctly enforce the intended semantics, we need to count the number of events each student has on each day and apply a penalty if the count is exactly one. Here is the corrected ASP code:

```asp

This rule checks for each student and each day whether they have exactly one event assigned. If so, it applies a penalty of 1.

INITIAL RESPONSE:
1 { assigned(Nurse, special_rest, DDay) : assigned(Nurse, night, DDay-1), assigned(Nurse, night, DDay) } 1 :- nurse(Nurse).

REPAIRED RESPONSE:
To ensure that nurses working on two consecutive nights get an additional special_rest day in addition to their ordinary rest days, we need to explicitly add the special_rest day when the condition is met. Here is the corrected ASP code:

```asp
1 { assigned(Nurse, special_rest, DDay) : assigned(Nurse, night, DDay-1), assigned(Nurse, night, DDay) } 1 :- nurse(Nurse).

% Ensure the special_rest day is in addition to the ordinary rest days
assigned(Nurse, rest, DDay) :- assigned(Nurse, night, DDay-1), assigned(Nurse, night, DDay), nurse(Nurse), day(DDay).
```

Explanation:
1. The first rule ensures that if a nurse works two consecutive nights, they must get a special_rest day.
2. The second rule ensures that the special_rest day is added in addition to the ordinary rest days.

This ensures that the special_rest day is in addition to any ordinary rest days the nurse might already have.
