The event spans two full days, and each\nday is divided into three time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon.\nYou have access to three rooms where these workshops can be held.\nEvery workshop must be placed somewhere in the schedule \u2014 that is,\nassigned to at least one session at a specific room and a specific time on\none of the two days.\nNo two workshops can occupy the same room at the same time, and each\nroom is limited to a maximum of two workshops per day. So, on any\ngiven day, each room will have at least one unused time slot.\nHowever, one of the rooms comes with a constraint: Room 2 is unavailable\nin the afternoon, on both days. You\u2019ll need to avoid scheduling anything\nthere during that time.\nTopic-specific requirements further shape the schedule. AI workshops must\nalways be held in the morning, so they cannot be scheduled at midday or\nin the afternoon. Math workshops must not overlap with each other in\ntime, meaning that no two math sessions can occur simultaneously\n \u2014 even if they\u2019re in different rooms. In addition, AI and Biology\nworkshops must not share a room on the same day. If an AI session\ntakes place in a given room on a given day, then no Biology session\ncan be placed in that room on that day, and vice versa.\nFinally, to ensure balanced subject coverage, each day must include at\nleast one workshop from each topic \u2014 AI, Math, and Bio \u2014 so no subject\nis omitted from a day\u2019s agenda.\nWhen choosing among valid schedules, it\u2019s preferable to use space\nefficiently: try to fill as many available slots as possible while\nrespecting all the constraints.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe\u2019re finally getting the green light to assemble that new workstation for our AI research, but there\u2019s a catch: we have to keep the hardware costs as low as humanly possible while ensuring every single part is compatible. We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4. Optimization Objective\nDefine an objective function to maximize the total room utilization $U$, where $U = \\sum_{d,t,r} \\mathbb{1}(x_{d,t,r} \\neq \\emptyset)$. The goal is to maximize $U$ subject to the constraints above, ensuring the highest possible density of sessions without violating the logical framework of the symposium.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

As you know, we need to build a complete package that includes exactly one data plan, one specific phone model, and a single accessory.\n\nOur options for the data plans are pretty straightforward: we have either the BasicData or the PremiumData. For the hardware, the customer can choose between the ModelX and the ModelY. To finish it off, we need to include an accessory, which will be either CaseA or CaseB.\n\nHowever, there are a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. For starters, we can't offer the BasicData plan to anyone who picks the ModelY, as they just aren't compatible. Furthermore, the ModelX is designed with a very specific form factor, so if someone chooses that phone, they are required to take CaseA. The final complication is that our PremiumData plan has some interference issues with the materials in CaseA, so those two can never be paired together.\n\nAfter sitting down and mapping out the dependencies, I\u2019ve found a configuration that works perfectly without breaking any of these rules. We should set the customer up with the PremiumData plan, the ModelY phone, and CaseB. This combination satisfies everything: by choosing the ModelY, we avoid the BasicData conflict, and since we aren't using the ModelX, we aren't forced into using CaseA. This allows us to use CaseB, which keeps the PremiumData plan running exactly as it should."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one data plan from {BasicData, PremiumData}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "plan(\"BasicData\"; \"PremiumData\").\n1 { selected_plan(P) : plan(P) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one phone model from {ModelX, ModelY}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "phone(\"ModelX\"; \"ModelY\").\n1 { selected_phone(M) : phone(M) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one accessory from {CaseA, CaseB}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "accessory(\"CaseA\"; \"CaseB\").\n1 { selected_accessory(A) : accessory(A) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BasicData is not compatible with ModelY."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_plan(\"BasicData\"), selected_phone(\"ModelY\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ModelX requires CaseA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_phone(\"ModelX\"), selected_accessory(A), A != \"CaseA\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: PremiumData cannot be used with CaseA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_plan(\"PremiumData\"), selected_accessory(\"CaseA\")."}]}

To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### **Exercise: Multi-Constraint Path Optimization in a Thermal-Temporal State Space**\n\n#### **1. System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### Exercise 4.2: Constrained Optimization in System Configuration\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nIn the design of a specialized workstation for data-intensive computational simulations, a systems architect must select a hardware configuration consisting of exactly one Central Processing Unit (CPU), one Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and one Storage Unit (SU). The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.
