Imagine you’ve been brought in to oversee a complex logistics operation where we need to move several packages across a network of specific locations. Each location is connected by a series of defined routes, but there is a catch: every route has a specific fuel cost associated with it. Our trucks aren’t running on unlimited reserves, so every move we make must be calculated against the limited fuel each vehicle has at its disposal.

The operation follows a very strict timeline where we can only perform exactly one action at any given time step across the entire fleet. We have three primary tools at our disposal to get these packages to their final destinations. First, if a truck and a package are currently at the same location, we can use a time step to load that package onto the truck. Second, once a truck reaches the intended destination, we can spend a step to unload the package. Naturally, these actions are only possible if the truck and the package are in the same physical spot; we can't load a package if the truck is still two towns away.

The third action is driving. We can move a truck from its current location to a new one, provided there is a direct route connecting them. However, this is where our fuel management becomes critical. Every time a truck moves, it consumes an amount of fuel exactly equal to the cost of that specific route. If a truck doesn't have enough fuel left in its tank to cover the cost of the trip, it simply cannot make the journey.

Our ultimate goal is to coordinate these movements so that every package ends up at its designated target location. To solve this, we need to provide a precise sequence of these individual actions—loading, driving, and unloading—ensuring that every move is legally permitted by our current resources and locations until the job is finished.
