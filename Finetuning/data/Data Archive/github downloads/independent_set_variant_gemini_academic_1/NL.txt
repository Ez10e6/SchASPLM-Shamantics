**Exercise: The Maximum Independent Set Problem**

**Problem Statement**
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected, simple graph, where $V$ denotes a finite set of vertices (entities) and $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ represents the set of edges (binary relations) between them.

A subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ is defined as an **independent set** if it satisfies the following condition:
$$\forall u, v \in S, \{u, v\} \notin E$$
That is, no two distinct vertices within the subset $S$ are adjacent in $G$.

**Objective**
The goal of the **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)** problem is to identify an independent set $S^*$ that maximizes the cardinality of the subset. Formally, solve the following optimization problem:
$$\text{Maximize } |S|$$
$$\text{subject to } S \subseteq V \text{ and } (S \times S) \cap E = \emptyset$$

The cardinality of such a set, denoted by $\alpha(G)$, is referred to as the **independence number** of the graph. Provide a formal characterization of the subset $S^*$ for a given graph $G$ and discuss the computational complexity of determining $\alpha(G)$ in the general case.
