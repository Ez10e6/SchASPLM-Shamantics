I wanted to walk you through the logic behind the 9x9 grid challenge we’re currently tackling. To get started, imagine a large square framework divided into nine rows and nine columns, each indexed from one to nine. This layout isn’t just one large open space, though; it is further partitioned into nine distinct 3x3 subgrids that sit within the larger structure.

Our primary objective is to populate every single cell within this grid so that each one contains exactly one number ranging from one to nine. However, we have to be very careful about where we place these digits because there are three specific layers of constraints we need to follow simultaneously.

First, we have to ensure that every horizontal row across the grid contains each number from one to nine exactly once. At the same time, we must apply that same logic vertically, making sure that every column from top to bottom also features a single occurrence of every number in that range. Finally, we have to look at those nine smaller 3x3 subgrids I mentioned earlier; each of those blocks must also contain exactly one of every number from one to nine without any repeats or omissions. Once we have filled every cell while respecting these row, column, and subgrid requirements, we will have our completed grid.
