Imagine you’re helping me organize the guest list for an upcoming high-stakes gala where the social dynamics are a bit of a minefield. We have a master list of potential attendees, but the catch is that many of them have personal rivalries or professional conflicts with one another. I’ve already mapped out these specific tensions as a series of connections between individual people. 

To ensure the evening goes off without a hitch, we have to follow one strict rule: we can never invite two people if there is a recorded conflict between them. If a pair of individuals is connected by one of these social "edges," only one of them can be in the room at a time. Within those boundaries, our primary objective is to make the event as well-attended as possible. We need to look at the entire network of connections and strategically select a group of guests that allows us to reach the highest possible head count without ever placing two conflicting individuals together.
