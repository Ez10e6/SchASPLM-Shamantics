**Exercise: The Fixed-Endpoint Minimum Weight Hamiltonian Path Problem**

**Problem Statement:**

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, undirected graph, where $V$ represents a finite set of vertices (entities) and $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ represents the set of edges. Each edge $\{u, v\} \in E$ is associated with a cost given by a weight function $w: E \to \mathbb{R}^+$.

Given a designated source vertex $s \in V$ and a designated terminal vertex $e \in V$ (where $s \neq e$), formulate an algorithm to identify a simple path $P = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ that satisfies the following conditions:

1.  **Boundary Constraints:** The sequence must originate at the source and terminate at the sink, such that $v_1 = s$ and $v_n = e$.
2.  **Hamiltonian Property:** The path $P$ must be a Hamiltonian path; that is, the sequence $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ must be a permutation of all vertices in $V$, ensuring each vertex $v \in V$ is visited exactly once.
3.  **Optimality Criterion:** The path must minimize the objective function $C(P)$, defined as the sum of the weights of the edges comprising the path:
    $$C(P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} w(\{v_i, v_{i+1}\})$$

**Deliverables:**
Identify the set of edges $E_P = \{\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \mid 1 \leq i < n\}$ that constitutes the optimal path subject to the aforementioned constraints. Discuss the computational complexity of this problem in the context of the traditional Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the $NP$-completeness of the Hamiltonian Path Problem.
