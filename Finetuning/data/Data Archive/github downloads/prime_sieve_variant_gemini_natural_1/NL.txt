Imagine we are working with a sequence of integers that begins at the number two and extends all the way to a specific upper limit, which we will refer to as $n$. Our objective is to carefully examine every value within this range to determine which ones qualify as prime numbers. To do this effectively, we need to distinguish between two types of integers based on their divisors.

We consider a number to be composite if it can be divided evenly by any integer other than one or itself. By contrast, any number that does not meet this criteria—meaning it lacks any extra divisors—is classified as a prime number. Our goal is to systematically filter through the entire span from two to $n$ and identify every single value that fits the definition of a prime. Once the process is complete, the final result should be a comprehensive set containing all the prime numbers found within that specified range.
