I was looking over that genealogical project we discussed, and I think I’ve finally mapped out the logic we need to verify that old "I’m My Own Grandpa" paradox. It’s a bit of a head-scratcher, but if we feed the right data into the system—specifically everyone’s gender, who their parents are, and their marriage status—we can let the rules do the heavy lifting.

The first thing the system needs to understand is that marriage is a two-way street. If our records show that one person is married to another, the logic must automatically recognize that the second person is married to the first. From there, we can define siblings quite simply as any two distinct individuals who share at least one parent in common. 

The real trick to the paradox, though, lies in how we handle stepparents. For the purposes of this logic check, we are treating stepparents exactly like biological parents. This means that if an individual is married to someone’s parent, they are formally considered a parent to that person as well. Once that rule is in place, the rest of the family tree starts to take shape. For instance, we’ll define an uncle as any male sibling of a parent, and a grandparent is naturally defined as the parent of a parent.

The ultimate goal of this whole exercise is to see if the data produces a "grandpa" in the most literal, recursive sense of the word. In this specific scenario, we are defining a grandpa as a male individual who somehow ends up being his own grandparent. We just need to run the individuals through these rules to see if anyone actually satisfies that loop.
