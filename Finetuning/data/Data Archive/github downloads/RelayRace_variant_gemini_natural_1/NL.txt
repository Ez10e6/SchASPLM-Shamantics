Imagine we’re sitting down to map out the logistics for our upcoming Relay Race Event. We have all the raw data ready to go, including the specific definitions for each leg of the race—notably where each segment starts and ends—as well as the precise distances between those points. We also have our full roster of participants and the initial assignments of who is running which section. Our goal now is to transform this data into a high-performance schedule that balances efficiency with runner satisfaction.

To get started, we need to establish a clear tracking system. This involves defining helper predicates that map every participant to their specific leg index so we can see the order of operations at a glance. By doing this, we can pinpoint exactly where each runner begins their portion of the relay and where they conclude it, effectively identifying every exchange point on the course. Once these handoff locations are set, we have to calculate the duration of every leg by factoring in the specific runner’s pace. This allows us to generate a comprehensive profile for each participant that totals their individual distance, as well as the total ascent and descent they will encounter during their run.

With the foundation built, we can move into the optimization phase to ensure the race is as smooth and fair as possible. First and foremost, we want to keep our runners happy by minimizing the difference between the distance they’ve told us they prefer to run and the actual distance we’ve assigned them. From a competitive standpoint, we are also looking to minimize the total duration of the entire race to ensure the fastest possible finish. 

Efficiency is also key at the exchange points, so our model needs to minimize the total number of runner handoffs throughout the event to keep the baton moving steadily. Finally, we need to look at the physical demands placed on our athletes; we should aim to minimize the variance between a runner’s actual pace during their legs and their stated preferred pace. By balancing these four objectives, we can ensure the event is not only logistically sound but also tailored to the strengths and preferences of our participants.
