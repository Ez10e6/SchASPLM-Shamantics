**Exercise 4.12: The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem**

**Problem Statement:**
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph, where $V$ denotes the finite set of vertices and $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ represents the set of edges. 

**Definition (Vertex Cover):**
A subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ is defined as a *vertex cover* of $G$ if it satisfies the following condition: for every edge $e = \{u, v\} \in E$, the intersection $e \cap S$ is non-empty. Formally, $S$ is a vertex cover if:
$$\forall \{u, v\} \in E : (u \in S) \lor (v \in S)$$

**Objective:**
Given the graph $G$, the objective of the Minimum Vertex Cover problem is to identify a vertex cover $S^*$ that minimizes the cardinality of the set. The optimization problem is formulated as follows:
$$\text{Minimize } |S|$$
$$\text{subject to } S \subseteq V \text{ and } S \text{ is a vertex cover of } G.$$

**Task:**
1. Formulate a mathematical proof or an algorithmic approach to determine the optimal subset $S^*$.
2. Discuss the computational complexity of this optimization task, specifically addressing its classification within the hierarchy of complexity classes (e.g., NP-optimization).
