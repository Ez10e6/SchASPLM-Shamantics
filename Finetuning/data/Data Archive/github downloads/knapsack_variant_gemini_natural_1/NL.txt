Picture yourself standing in a storage room filled with various pieces of equipment, each assigned a specific market value and a precise weight. You’ve been given a single transport container with a fixed weight capacity, which we can refer to as "n." 

Your objective is to decide which specific pieces of equipment to pack into that container to ensure you're walking away with the highest possible total value. However, the rules are strict: the combined weight of every item you select must stay within the container's weight limit. Furthermore, this isn't a situation where you can take a fraction of an item or break it apart to save space; for every single object in the room, you must make a binary choice to either take it in its entirety or leave it behind. Your success depends on finding that perfect combination of items that maximizes your total return while respecting the physical boundaries of the container.
