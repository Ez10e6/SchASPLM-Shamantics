% Generate a candidate subset of items to include in the knapsack.
{ knapsack(V, W) } :- item(V, W).

% Constraint: The sum of weights of the included items must not exceed the capacity n.
:- #sum { W, V : knapsack(V, W) } > n.

% Maximize the total value of the included items.
#maximize { V, W : knapsack(V, W) }.
