Imagine we are standing in the control room of a high-tech warehouse that has been laid out as a massive, rectangular grid. The floor is divided into a precise number of rows and columns, and scattered across this expanse are several specialized robots, each waiting at its assigned starting position. Throughout the grid, we’ve also installed permanent barriers and thick steel walls that cannot be moved. Our objective today is to navigate these robots across the floor so that specific units reach their designated target locations.

However, the way these robots navigate is a bit unusual because of their high-momentum propulsion systems. When you decide to move a robot, you can only send it in one of the four cardinal directions: North, South, East, or West. The critical thing to remember is that once a robot begins moving in a direction, it will slide continuously across the floor and cannot stop on its own. It will only come to a halt when it is physically blocked by an obstacle.

This obstacle could be one of the permanent walls we’ve mapped out or even another robot that happens to be sitting in its path. When the robot hits such a barrier, it stops at the very last valid square right before the impact. You have to be careful with your planning because a robot is incapable of stopping mid-path; it must slide the full distance until it is forced to stop.

Every move you make involves selecting exactly one robot and choosing its direction of travel. To complete the mission, you must provide us with a detailed log of the sequence of moves you made, noting which robot was moved, which direction it traveled, and the time at which the move occurred. You need to achieve the final target configuration within a specific maximum number of moves, so every slide must be calculated with precision.
