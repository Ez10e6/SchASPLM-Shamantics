Imagine we are looking at a blueprint for a new security layout in a complex facility where several key intersections are linked together by a network of corridors. Our task is to ensure that every single hallway in the building is monitored by a security guard. To do this, we can station guards at the intersections, but we don't necessarily need one at every point. 

The rule is straightforward: for every corridor that connects two intersections, at least one of those two intersections must have a guard stationed at it to keep an eye on that specific path. If a guard is at one end of a hallway, the entire hallway is considered secure. Our ultimate goal is to design a staffing plan that satisfies this requirement for every corridor in the entire network while being as efficient as possible. This means we need to identify the specific set of intersections that allows us to cover every path using the absolute minimum number of guards.
