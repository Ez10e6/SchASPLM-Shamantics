### System Specification: River Crossing Logistics Problem

#### 1. System Entities
Define the set of active entities $E = \{F, W, G, C\}$, where:
*   **F**: Farmer (Operator)
*   **W**: Wolf
*   **G**: Goat
*   **C**: Cabbage

#### 2. State Space and Initial Conditions
*   **Locations**: Let $L = \{Left\_Bank, Right\_Bank\}$.
*   **State Definition**: The state of the system at time $t$ is defined by the position of all entities: $S_t = \{(e, l) \mid e \in E, l \in L\}$.
*   **Initial State ($t=0$)**: $\forall e \in E, pos(e) = Left\_Bank$.
*   **Goal State ($t=T$)**: $\forall e \in E, pos(e) = Right\_Bank$.

#### 3. Operational Constraints (Transitions)
For each time step $t \in \{0, \dots, T-1\}$, a transition to $S_{t+1}$ must adhere to the following:
*   **Operator Requirement**: The Farmer ($F$) must change location in every transition.
*   **Transport Capacity**: In each step, the Farmer may transport at most one item $i \in \{W, G, C\}$ or travel alone.
*   **Co-location Requirement**: An item $i$ can only change location if its position at time $t$ is identical to the Farmer's position at time $t$.
*   **Directionality**: The boat must move from the Farmer's current bank to the opposite bank.

#### 4. Safety Invariants (Prohibited States)
A state $S_t$ is invalid if any of the following conditions are met:
*   **Predation (Wolf/Goat)**: $pos(W) = pos(G)$ AND $pos(F) \neq pos(W)$.
*   **Herbivory (Goat/Cabbage)**: $pos(G) = pos(C)$ AND $pos(F) \neq pos(G)$.

#### 5. Objective
Determine a sequence of transitions (moves) $M = \{m_1, m_2, \dots, m_T\}$ such that:
1.  The sequence begins at the **Initial State**.
2.  The sequence terminates at the **Goal State**.
3.  Every intermediate state $S_t$ satisfies all **Safety Invariants**.
4.  The total number of steps $T$ is minimized or falls within the specified temporal bound.
