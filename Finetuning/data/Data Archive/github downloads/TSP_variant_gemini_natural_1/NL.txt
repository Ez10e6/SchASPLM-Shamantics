Imagine we are looking at a map of several locations connected by a network of roads. Each road connects two points and has a specific weight or cost associated with traveling along it. Because the connections are undirected, we can travel in either direction between two locations once a path exists. We have been assigned a specific itinerary that must begin at a designated starting point, which we will call node 's', and conclude at a final destination, node 'e'.

The challenge of this journey is that we are required to visit every single location in the network. We cannot skip any nodes, nor are we allowed to revisit any location once we have been there; the path must take us through each node exactly once. This means we are searching for a perfect Hamiltonian Path that links our starting point to our ending point while touching every other spot on the map in between.

While there may be several different ways to navigate this network, our ultimate goal is to find the one route that is the most cost-effective. We need to calculate the sum of the weights for all the roads we choose and identify the path where this total cost is minimized. Once we have determined the most efficient route that meets all these criteria, we simply need to identify the specific sequence of edges that form this optimal path.
