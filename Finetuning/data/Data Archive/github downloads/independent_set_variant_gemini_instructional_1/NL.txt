### Formal Specification: Maximum Independent Set (MIS) Problem

**1. System Input**
*   Define an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where:
    *   $V$ is a finite set of vertices (nodes).
    *   $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ is a set of unordered pairs representing edges (connections) between vertices.

**2. Output Requirements**
*   Identify and return a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$.

**3. Operational Constraints**
*   **Independence Property:** Ensure that for every pair of vertices $\{u, v\} \subseteq S$, the edge $\{u, v\} \notin E$. No two vertices within the subset $S$ shall be adjacent.

**4. Objective Function**
*   **Cardinality Maximization:** Select $S$ such that its size $|S|$ is maximized. 
*   Formally, find $S$ such that $\forall S' \subseteq V$ satisfying the Independence Property, $|S| \geq |S'|$.
