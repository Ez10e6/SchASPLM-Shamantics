Imagine we are looking at a square grid, a board of size $n$ by $n$ where both the rows and the columns are indexed from $1$ up to $n$. We have a specific challenge ahead of us: we need to figure out how to place exactly $n$ queens onto this board. The catch is that these queens are incredibly territorial and cannot be positioned in a way that allows them to attack one another.

To solve this, we have to keep the standard rules of chess in mind. A queen is a powerful piece that dominates any square along its horizontal row, its vertical column, or any of the diagonal lines extending from its position. This means that for our arrangement to be successful, no two queens can ever share the same row or the same column. Furthermore, we must ensure that no two queens are placed on any shared diagonal path across the board. Our goal is to find a layout where all $n$ queens sit peacefully in their own space, with none of them threatening any of the others.
