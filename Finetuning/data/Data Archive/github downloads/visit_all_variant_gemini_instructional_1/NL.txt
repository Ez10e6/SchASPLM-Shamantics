### **Specification: Visit All Pathfinding Problem**

#### **1. System Definition**
The system is defined as a discrete-time environment modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a finite set of locations (nodes) and $E \subseteq \{ \{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v \}$ represents the set of bidirectional connections (edges) between those locations.

#### **2. Input Parameters**
*   **Initial State ($s$):** A starting node $s \in V$.
*   **Target Set ($T$):** A subset of nodes $T \subseteq V$ that must be traversed.
*   **Time Horizon ($L$):** A positive integer representing the maximum number of discrete time steps allowed for the path.

#### **3. Constraint Specification**
A valid solution must satisfy the following operational constraints:

*   **Initial Condition:** The sequence of locations $P = (p_0, p_1, \dots, p_k)$ must satisfy $p_0 = s$.
*   **Adjacency Requirement:** For every transition between consecutive time steps $t$ and $t+1$, the robot must move between connected nodes. Formally: $\{p_t, p_{t+1}\} \in E$ for all $t \in \{0, \dots, k-1\}$.
*   **Target Coverage:** The path must achieve full coverage of the target set. Formally: $\forall v \in T, \exists t \in \{0, \dots, k\}$ such that $p_t = v$.
*   **Temporal Bound:** The total number of transitions must not exceed the defined horizon. Formally: $k \leq L$.
*   **Unit Movement:** At each discrete time step, the robot must occupy exactly one node.

#### **4. Output Requirements**
The system must output a state sequence $P = (p_0, p_1, \dots, p_k)$ that represents the chronologically ordered path of nodes visited by the robot from the initial state until the final target is satisfied within the time horizon.
