Imagine we are looking at a complex network layout consisting of several individual nodes, many of which are tied together by direct connections or edges. Our team’s current mission is to assign a unique color to every single node within this system, but we have to follow one strict rule to avoid interference: if any two nodes are linked together by an edge, they are absolutely forbidden from sharing the same color. 

While it might seem simple to just use a different color for every node, our real objective is to be as resource-efficient as possible. We are tasked with finding the optimal solution by minimizing the total number of distinct colors used across the entire map. We need to determine the absolute smallest number of colors required to satisfy the connection rules for the entire graph, effectively identifying its chromatic number. Our goal is to complete the assignment so that no two connected nodes match, while ensuring the variety of our color palette is kept to the bare minimum.
