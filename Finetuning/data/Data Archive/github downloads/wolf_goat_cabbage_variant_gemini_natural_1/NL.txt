A farmer stands on the edge of a rushing river, facing a bit of a logistical nightmare. He needs to move his wolf, his goat, and a fresh head of cabbage from the left bank over to the right bank, but his only means of transport is a tiny rowing boat. This boat is so small that it can only accommodate the farmer himself and one of his three possessions at a time. He can choose to row across with the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage, or even row alone, but he must always be the one manning the oars to make the trip.

The real trouble lies in what happens when he isn’t looking. If he leaves the wolf and the goat alone on either bank without his supervision, the wolf will naturally follow its instincts and eat the goat. Similarly, if the goat and the cabbage are left together without the farmer there to intervene, the cabbage will quickly become the goat’s lunch. The wolf and the cabbage, however, can be left alone together safely. To get everyone across the river within a reasonable number of trips, the farmer has to be incredibly strategic about who he leaves with whom.

He begins the process by taking the goat across first, as the wolf and the cabbage can be left alone on the left bank without any trouble. Once the goat is safely deposited on the right bank, the farmer rows back alone to the left side. Next, he picks up the wolf and transports it across. However, he knows he cannot leave the wolf and goat together on the right bank while he goes back for the cabbage, so he makes a clever move: he drops off the wolf but puts the goat back into the boat to accompany him on the return trip. 

Back at the left bank, he swaps the goat for the cabbage. He rows the cabbage across to the right bank and leaves it there with the wolf, who has no interest in eating the vegetable. Finally, he rows back to the left bank one last time to pick up the goat, bringing it across for the final crossing. Through this careful series of maneuvers, the farmer, the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage all reach the right bank completely unharmed.
