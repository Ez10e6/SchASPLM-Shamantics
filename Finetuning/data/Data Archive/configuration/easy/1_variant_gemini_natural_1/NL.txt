We’re finally putting together that basic custom PC build, and we need to make sure we select the right combination of core components from our current inventory. The goal is to assemble a system using exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one motherboard. For the processor, we have a choice between a Ryzen5 or an i5, and for the graphics card, we can go with either a GTX1660 or an RX580. To tie it all together, we have two motherboard options: the B450 and the Z390.

However, we have to navigate a few compatibility hurdles before we can finalize the parts list. If we decide to use the Ryzen5 CPU, it is only compatible with the B450 motherboard, meaning those two must stay together. On the other hand, if we opt for the i5 CPU, that processor will only function with the Z390 motherboard. There is one final complication regarding the graphics cards; specifically, the RX580 GPU cannot be paired with the Z390 motherboard under any circumstances. As long as you keep those hardware restrictions in mind, we just need to settle on a valid combination that satisfies all these constraints.
