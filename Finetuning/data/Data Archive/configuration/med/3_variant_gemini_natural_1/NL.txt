We are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.

Starting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.

The tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. 

We also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor. Our task now is to find the specific combination of frame, motor, and battery that respects all these compatibility rules while pushing our total endurance score to the highest possible number.
