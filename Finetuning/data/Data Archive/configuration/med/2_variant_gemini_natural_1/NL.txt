Imagine we are sitting down to spec out a high-end gaming laptop for a client who wants the absolute best performance possible. We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.

For the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.

The challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components—specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070—the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture. Our job is to find the perfect mix of these parts that yields the highest total score while respecting every one of these hardware requirements.
