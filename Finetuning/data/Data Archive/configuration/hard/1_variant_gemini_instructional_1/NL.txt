### **System Specification: Workstation Configuration for Data-Intensive Simulations**

#### **1. Component Catalog**
The procurement office defines the available hardware pool across three distinct categories. Each category contains three mutually exclusive options.

**1.1 Central Processing Units (CPU)**
| Model | Performance Score | Cost (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| X9 | 95 | $300 |
| ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |
| Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |

**1.2 Graphics Processing Units (GPU)**
| Model | Performance Score | Cost (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |
| NovaX | 125 | $600 |
| GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |

**1.3 Storage Units (STG)**
| Model | Performance Score | Cost (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |
| FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |
| MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |

#### **2. Selection Requirements**
A valid workstation configuration must satisfy the following cardinality and logic rules:

*   **Mandatory Inclusion:** Select exactly one (1) component from each category: {CPU, GPU, STG}.
*   **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component with the highest cost in the final selection must also be the component with the highest performance score in that selection.
*   **Anti-Saturation Rule:** The final selection must not simultaneously include the highest-rated performance part from all three categories (i.e., the set {ZetaCore, QuasarRTX, UltraSSD} is prohibited).
*   **Fiscal Balance:** The price delta between the most expensive component and the least expensive component in the selection must not exceed $250.
*   **Performance Hierarchy:** The performance score of the selected GPU must be less than or equal to the performance score of the selected CPU.

---

#### **3. Compatibility and Dependency Constraints**
The selection is subject to specific hardware and procurement interdependencies:

*   **BIOS Conflict:** The Alpha8 CPU is incompatible with the NovaX GPU. These components must not be paired in the same configuration.
*   **Procurement Dependency:** The FusionDrive storage unit is restricted for use only in configurations utilizing the ZetaCore CPU. If FusionDrive is selected, ZetaCore must be the selected CPU.

#### **4. Objective**
Identify a configuration $\{CPU_i, GPU_j, STG_k\}$ that adheres to all constraints listed in Sections 2 and 3 while optimizing for the specific data-intensive requirements of the workstation.
