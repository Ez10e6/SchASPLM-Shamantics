The procurement team has adopted a new philosophy for our latest batch of data-processing workstations, moving away from raw power in favor of what they call "proportional utility." As you start putting these builds together, you’ll need to select exactly one component from each of the three categories available in our inventory. For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.

The assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU’s score must be the "middle" value of the three parts—it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you’ve chosen.

There are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100. By following these guidelines, we should end up with a workstation that is perfectly optimized for our needs without overspending on unnecessary power.
