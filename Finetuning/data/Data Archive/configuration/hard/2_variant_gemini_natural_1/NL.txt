Hey, it looks like we finally got the green light to assemble the new 3D rendering suite for the media lab, but the budget committee is being incredibly meticulous about how we allocate the funds. We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories—CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies—while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.

For the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we’re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.

The first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.

There are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you’ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. 

Finally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They’ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400. It’s going to take some careful balancing to make sure we meet all these requirements without the whole thing blowing up—literally or financially.
