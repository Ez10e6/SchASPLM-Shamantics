Listen, we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands with the upcoming semester’s timetable, and I wanted to walk you through the parameters we need to juggle. Our main goal is to get every course lecture assigned to a specific day, timeslot, and room, but there are several non-negotiable rules we have to follow to make the schedule even functional.

First and foremost, we have to ensure that every single lecture defined for a course actually gets a spot on the calendar. When we’re placing these, we can’t have two lectures for the exact same course happening in the same period. It’s also vital that we avoid any overlaps for the students and faculty; this means that lectures belonging to the same curriculum cannot happen at the same time, and a teacher can’t be in two places at once. Naturally, we can only have one lecture in any given room during a single period. We also have to respect the teachers' schedules, so we can't book them for a slot where they’ve already marked themselves as unavailable.

Once we’ve met those hard requirements, we need to look at how to make the schedule actually work well for everyone by minimizing a few specific penalties. For starters, we really need to keep an eye on room capacity so that the number of students doesn't exceed the available seats. We also want to make sure the courses are spread out reasonably, meeting a minimum number of working days rather than being crammed into too short a window. 

From a student’s perspective, the flow of the day is really important. We want to avoid isolated lectures by keeping a curriculum’s classes adjacent to one another, and we should try to eliminate "windows," which are those awkward empty gaps between classes on the same day. To keep things simple, we should aim for room stability, meaning all lectures for a specific course should ideally stay in the same room. We also need to monitor the daily student load; the number of lectures a curriculum has in a day should stay within a specific minimum and maximum range so they aren't under- or over-worked.

Finally, there are some logistical details to iron out. We should avoid making students trek across campus by ensuring consecutive lectures in a curriculum aren’t held in different buildings. We also need to match courses with rooms that are actually suitable for their specific needs. Lastly, if a course is designed to have "double lectures" or grouped sessions, we need to make sure those stay together in the schedule. If we can balance all of that, we’ll have a schedule that really works for everyone.
