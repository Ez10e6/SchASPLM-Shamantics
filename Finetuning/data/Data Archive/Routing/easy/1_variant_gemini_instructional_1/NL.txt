### System Specification: Autonomous Delivery Robot Navigation

#### 1. System Topology
Define the navigation environment as a graph $G = (V, E)$ where:
*   **Vertices ($V$):** $\{A, B, C, D, E\}$ representing discrete locations.
*   **Edges ($E$):** $\{(A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, E)\}$.
*   **Connectivity:** All edges are bidirectional, allowing traversal between adjacent nodes.

#### 2. Agent Initialization
*   **Starting Position:** Set the robot's initial location to Node $A$.
*   **Temporal State:** Initialize the mission clock at $T = 0$ minutes.

#### 3. Operational Constraints
*   **Movement Cost:** Assign a uniform temporal cost of 1 minute per edge traversal.
*   **Temporal Limit:** Complete the mission within a maximum duration of $T \leq 6$ minutes.
*   **Node Interaction:**
    *   The robot must visit Node $D$ exactly once.
    *   The robot must visit Node $E$ exactly once.
    *   The sequence of delivery (visiting $D$ before $E$, or $E$ before $D$) is non-deterministic and left to the agent's discretion.

#### 4. Mission Objective
Identify and execute a valid path sequence $P = (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_n)$ such that:
*   $v_0 = A$.
*   The set of visited nodes $\{v_0, \dots, v_n\}$ includes both $D$ and $E$.
*   The frequency of visits to $D$ and $E$ in $P$ is exactly 1 for each.
*   The total path length $n$ (where $n$ is the number of moves) satisfies $n \leq 6$.
