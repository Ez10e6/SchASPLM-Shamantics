We need to program the warehouse bot for its next delivery run, starting from its base at Station A. The facility is laid out with five specific stations, labeled A through E, but the bot is restricted to the marked paths on the floor. From its starting point at Station A, it can only move directly to Station B or Station D. If it travels to Station B, it then has access to Station C, while moving to Station D provides the only path to Station E.

The bot’s mission is to deliver supplies to both Station C and Station E exactly once during the trip. We have a strict limit of six moves total for this entire operation, with each movement between adjacent stations taking exactly one unit of time. At every step, the bot can transition to any station that is directly connected to its current location, provided it completes both deliveries within the allotted six-move timeframe.
