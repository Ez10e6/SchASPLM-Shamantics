**Exercise 4.12: Constrained Pathfinding in a Discrete Spatial Graph**

**Problem Statement:**
Consider an autonomous agent operating within a discrete environment modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The vertex set is defined as $V = \{A, B, C, D, E\}$, representing distinct spatial locations. The topology of the environment is defined by the following set of edges, representing bidirectional connectivity:
$$E = \{(A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, E)\}$$

Each transition between adjacent vertices $\{u, v\} \in E$ incurs a uniform temporal cost of $t = 1$ minute.

**Constraints and Objectives:**
The agent is initialized at starting vertex $s = A$. The objective is to achieve a set of delivery requirements defined by the target set $T = \{D, E\}$. A successful execution must satisfy the following formal conditions:

1.  **Coverage:** The agent must visit every vertex $v \in T$.
2.  **Uniqueness:** Each target vertex $v \in T$ must be visited exactly once during the traversal.
3.  **Temporal Bound:** The total path cost $C$, defined as the sum of all edge weights in the sequence, must satisfy the constraint $C \leq 6$.

**Task:**
Formalize the agent's movement as a sequence of vertices (a path) and determine the set of all feasible paths that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. Prove whether the order of visitation between the elements of $T$ affects the feasibility of the solution under the temporal bound.
