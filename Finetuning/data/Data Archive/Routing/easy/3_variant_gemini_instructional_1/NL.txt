### System Specification: Warehouse Autonomous Navigation and Delivery

#### 1. System Topology
The environment is defined as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents the set of stations and $E$ represents the set of bidirectional traversable paths.
*   **Nodes ($V$):** $\{A, B, C, D, E\}$
*   **Edges ($E$):** 
    *   $(A, B)$
    *   $(A, D)$
    *   $(B, C)$
    *   $(D, E)$

#### 2. Initial State
*   **Starting Location:** The bot shall be initialized at node $A$ at time $t = 0$.
*   **Current Location ($L_t$):** $L_0 = A$.

#### 3. Execution Constraints
*   **Temporal Budget:** The system is limited to a maximum of 6 discrete moves ($t_{max} = 6$).
*   **Move Duration:** Each edge traversal $(\Delta t)$ is equal to 1 time unit.
*   **Adjacency Requirement:** For any transition from $L_t$ to $L_{t+1}$, the pair $(L_t, L_{t+1})$ must exist within the set of defined edges $E$.
*   **Node Revisit:** The bot may revisit any node within the temporal budget to fulfill objective requirements.

#### 4. Objective Criteria
The bot must achieve a "Delivered" status for specific target stations. The mission is successful if and only if:
*   **Target C:** There exists some $t \in [1, 6]$ such that $L_t = C$.
*   **Target E:** There exists some $t \in [1, 6]$ such that $L_t = E$.
*   **Delivery Sequence:** Targets $C$ and $E$ may be visited in any order.

#### 5. Operational Logic
1.  **Initialize** at $L_0 = A$.
2.  **Execute** a sequence of moves $M = \{m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n\}$ where $n \le 6$.
3.  **Validate** that for every move $m_i$, the destination is adjacent to the previous node.
4.  **Terminate** upon reaching the state where both $\{C, E\}$ have been included in the set of visited nodes, or when $t = 6$.
