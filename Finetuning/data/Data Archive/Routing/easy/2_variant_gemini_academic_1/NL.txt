**Exercise: Constrained Path Traversal in a Finite Undirected Graph**

**Problem Statement:**
Consider a discrete-time navigational model represented by an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The vertex set is defined as $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, and the edge set $E$ is established by the following adjacencies: 
$$E = \{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)\}$$

An autonomous agent is deployed at an initial state $v_0 = 1$. The agent must perform a walk of length $k = 5$, defined as a sequence of vertices $(v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5)$, where each transition $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ corresponds to an edge in $E$ for all $i \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$.

**Constraints:**
The traversal is subject to the following conditions:
1.  **Temporal Constraint:** The path must consist of exactly five transitions (equivalent to five units of discrete time).
2.  **Adjacency Constraint:** Each move must be between adjacent nodes as defined by $E$.
3.  **Coverage Requirement:** The set of visited vertices $S = \{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\}$ must satisfy the condition $\{3, 4\} \subseteq S$. The vertices 3 and 4 may be visited in any order and at any point within the sequence.

**Objective:**
Formally determine the set of all valid sequences $P$ that satisfy the initial state, the graph topology, and the coverage requirements. Show your derivation by considering the parity of the graph or by exhaustive state-space enumeration.
