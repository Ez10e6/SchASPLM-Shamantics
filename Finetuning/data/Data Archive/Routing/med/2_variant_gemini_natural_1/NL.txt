We are preparing to deploy a water-sampling drone into the subterranean aqueduct network, and there are several operational parameters you need to keep in mind for this mission. The drone will launch from the designated LaunchPad with its 16-liter internal tank capacity fully available. Every action the drone takes—whether it is moving through a tunnel, collecting a sample, or performing a refill—is considered a single "event," and the entire mission must be completed within a strict limit of 18 total events and a maximum duration of 10 minutes.

The aqueducts are one-way tunnels, and navigating them is taxing on the drone’s resources. Moving through any tunnel takes exactly one minute and consumes a specific volume of the drone's tank capacity. From the LaunchPad, the drone can enter Tunnel 1, which costs 2 liters, or Tunnel 2, which costs 3 liters. Tunnel 1 leads directly to Station A, while Tunnel 2 provides access to either Station B or a specialized calibration shaft known as CalibEdge. If the drone is at Station A, it can proceed through Tunnel 3 (at a cost of 1 liter) to loop back into the entrance of Tunnel 2. If it is at the CalibEdge, it can move into Station C at a cost of 2 liters. Finally, Station C funnels back into the entrance of Tunnel 1, though this return trip is quite heavy, costing 2 liters of volume.

Sampling itself is a delicate process. Collecting a single sample at any station takes one minute and consumes 1 liter of the remaining tank capacity. To prevent cross-contamination, the drone is strictly prohibited from taking two samples at the same station consecutively. While the 16-liter capacity is limited, the drone can recover 3 liters of capacity by idling for two consecutive minutes at the CalibEdge; however, this refill procedure can only be performed once during the mission.

The mission's success depends on meeting specific deadlines. We are required to collect at least one sample from both Station A and Station B. The first sample at Station A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark. While Station C is an optional target, the drone is only permitted to collect a sample there if, and only if, the mandatory samples from both Station A and Station B are successfully completed within the first 8 minutes of the mission. 

Our primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected, including the optional one at Station C. If we can achieve the same number of samples using different routes, our secondary priority is to choose the path that completes the final mandatory sample at the earliest possible time. All operations must conclude by the 10-minute deadline without ever exceeding the 16-liter tank limit.
