Our mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.

Once the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower’s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.

The operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.

The drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. 

As we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time. Finally, keep in mind that the drone is limited to a maximum of 20 total stops throughout the mission, a count that includes every minute spent traveling, scanning, or idling.
