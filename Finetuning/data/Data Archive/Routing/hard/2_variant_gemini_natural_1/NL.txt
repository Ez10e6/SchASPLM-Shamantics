As our autonomous rover prepares to navigate the subterranean tunnel network of the Mars base, we need to carefully map out its trajectory from the LaunchPad. The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events—counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill—to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.

From the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.

The mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.

If the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.

Every movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system. Our ultimate goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected. In the event that multiple routes yield the same number of samples, we will prioritize the plan that completes the mandatory sampling at StationA and StationB in the shortest amount of time.
