Our survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone’s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.

The geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.

The core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.

We have a strict limit of 16 total actions—which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period—before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone’s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize "wasted" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses.
