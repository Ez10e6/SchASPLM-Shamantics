We are currently finalizing the layout for our upcoming three-day symposium, which will feature a total of twelve workshops spread across four key disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Mathematics, and Linguistics. The event is hosted in a venue with four rooms, and each day is structured into three distinct sessions consisting of a morning, a midday, and an evening slot. Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.

As we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly. No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.

Thematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.

To keep the daily schedule organized, we’ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won’t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.

Our objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules. We want to fill as many of the available slots as the logic allows, ensuring the symposium is as robust as possible while respecting every constraint.
