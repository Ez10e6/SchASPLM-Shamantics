Hey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we’re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.

First off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can’t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can’t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This "non-consecutive" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.

There are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn’t have a projector, so it’s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.

When it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn’t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. 

Regarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density—no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.

There are two "anchor" sessions we’ve already promised. The very first session of the event—early morning on Day 1—must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. 

To keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a "monopoly" for just one subject area.

As you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind. If you find multiple ways to satisfy all these rules, our first priority is to maximize the number of rooms in use during each session to give the event a high-energy feel. After that, we want to minimize the total number of idle room-time slots across the four days, provided it doesn't conflict with any of the other requirements. Let me know if you run into any snags while mapping this out.
