### **System Specification: Two-Day Research Symposium Scheduler**

#### **1. Temporal and Spatial Domain**
*   **Duration:** 2 Days ($D = \{1, 2\}$).
*   **Daily Schedule:** 4 Time Segments per day ($T = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$):
    *   $T_1$: Morning
    *   $T_2$: Late Morning
    *   $T_3$: Early Afternoon
    *   $T_4$: Late Afternoon
*   **Venues:** 5 Distinct Rooms ($R = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$).
*   **Total Seminars:** 10 ($S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{10}\}$).
*   **Fields/Topics:** $\text{Field} \in \{AI, Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry\}$.

#### **2. Resource and Venue Constraints**
*   **Capacity:** Each room may host a maximum of one seminar per time segment.
*   **Room 3 Availability:** Restricted to $T_1$ and $T_2$ only. The room is offline for $T_3$ and $T_4$ on both days.
*   **Technical Limitation (Room 5):** Room 5 lacks projection equipment. Seminars requiring slides cannot be assigned to $R_5$.
*   **Daily Utilization Cap:** No room may be booked for more than 2 segments per day (50% of daily capacity).
*   **Buffer Requirement:** No room may host back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied at $T_n$, it must remain vacant at $T_{n-1}$ and $T_{n+1}$ within the same day.

#### **3. Field-Specific Constraints**
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    *   **Equipment:** Requires a projector (Prohibited in $R_5$).
    *   **Temporal Restriction:** Must be scheduled in $T_1$ or $T_2$ (Morning/Late Morning) only.
*   **Mathematics (MATH):**
    *   **Equipment:** Requires a projector (Prohibited in $R_5$).
    *   **Framing:** The first seminar of the symposium ($D_1, T_1$) and the final seminar of the symposium ($D_2, T_4$) must be Mathematics sessions.
*   **Biology (BIO):**
    *   **Distribution:** Seminars must be scheduled across both days; they cannot all occur on a single day.
    *   **Concurrency:** No two Biology seminars may occur simultaneously (maximum of one BIO session per time segment).
*   **Chemistry (CHEM):**
    *   **Exclusivity:** No two Chemistry seminars may occupy the same room over the duration of the two-day event.
*   **Interspecies Exclusion (BIO/CHEM):**
    *   A Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar cannot be scheduled in the same room on the same day.

#### **4. Scheduling and Optimization Logic**
*   **Mandatory Completion:** All 10 seminars must be assigned a unique (Day, Time, Room) coordinate.
*   **Gap Minimization:** Empty time segments must be avoided. The schedule must prioritize filling slots to ensure continuity unless constraints prohibit it.
*   **Field Diversity:** Each time segment ($D_d, T_t$) must maximize the number of distinct fields represented.
*   **Parallelism Limit:** In any single time segment ($D_d, T_t$), the combined total of Biology and Chemistry seminars running concurrently must not exceed two.

#### **5. Technical Requirement Summary (Room/Topic Matrix)**
| Field | Requires Projector (No R5) | Time Restriction | Room Restriction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI** | Yes | $T_1, T_2$ only | None |
| **MATH** | Yes | None (Except Open/Close) | None |
| **BIO** | No | Spread across $D_1, D_2$ | No BIO+CHEM in same room/day |
| **CHEM** | No | None | Max 1 per room total; No BIO+CHEM in same room/day |
