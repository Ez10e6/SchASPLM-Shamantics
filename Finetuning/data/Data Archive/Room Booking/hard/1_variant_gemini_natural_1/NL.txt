We have a significant puzzle to solve regarding the upcoming two-day research symposium. We’re dealing with ten seminars across four fields—Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry—and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.

First, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren’t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.

The technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we’ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.

When it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.

As we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields. If we can balance these technical quirks and room capacities, we’ll have a seamless program that serves both our presenters and our guests.
