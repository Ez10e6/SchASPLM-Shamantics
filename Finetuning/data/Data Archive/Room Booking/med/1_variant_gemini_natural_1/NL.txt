We are finalizing the logistics for our upcoming two-day symposium, and we need to find a place for all ten of our scheduled seminars. The event is spread across two days, with each day broken down into three specific time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon. We have four rooms at our disposal for these sessions, but keep in mind that a room can only host one seminar during any single time slot.

When you start mapping out the topics—AI, Biology, and Math—there are several departmental requirements we have to honor. The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you’ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.

We also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you’ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.

Finally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot. Additionally, for Seminars 6 and 7, the organizers have requested that they both be held in the exact same room, though they must be scheduled on different days to give the attendees some breathing room between the two sessions.
