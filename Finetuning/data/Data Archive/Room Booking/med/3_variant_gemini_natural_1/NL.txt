Hey there, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for that upcoming event we’re planning. We have six workshops in total that need to be slotted into a single day, and they’re divided among three main topics: Data, DevOps, and User Interface. The venue has given us three rooms to work with, and the day itself is split into three distinct time blocks—the morning, midday, and afternoon sessions.

As we put this together, we have to make sure every one of those six workshops is assigned to a specific room and a specific time slot. However, the venue has a strict policy that no single room can host more than two sessions over the course of the day. Of course, this also means we can’t have two different workshops occupying the same room at the same time.

The content of the workshops adds another layer of complexity to the schedule. The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.

To make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics—Data, DevOps, and UI—is represented at least once on the final schedule. Finally, as we piece this puzzle together, our goal is to be as efficient as possible with the venue's space. We want to minimize any unused room-time slots, making the most of our booking while staying strictly within all these logistical boundaries.
