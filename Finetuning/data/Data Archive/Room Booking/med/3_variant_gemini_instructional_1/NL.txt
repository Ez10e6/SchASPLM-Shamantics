### Workshop Scheduling System Specification

#### 1. System Entities and Domains
Define the following finite sets for the scheduling domain:
*   **Workshops ($W$):** A set of six unique sessions $\{w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6\}$.
*   **Topics ($T$):** {Data, DevOps, User Interface (UI)}.
*   **Time Slots ($S$):** {Morning, Midday, Afternoon}.
*   **Rooms ($R$):** {Room 1, Room 2, Room 3}.

#### 2. Functional Requirements
The system must generate a schedule that maps every workshop to a specific topic, time slot, and room.
*   **Assignment:** Each workshop $w \in W$ must be assigned exactly one topic $t \in T$, one time slot $s \in S$, and one room $r \in R$.
*   **Topic Coverage:** Every topic $t \in T$ must be assigned to at least one workshop $w \in W$.

#### 3. Logistical Constraints
*   **Spatial Uniqueness:** No two workshops may occupy the same $(s, r)$ pair. For any distinct $w_i, w_j \in W$, the assignment $(s_i, r_i)$ must not equal $(s_j, r_j)$.
*   **Room Utilization Cap:** No room $r \in R$ may be assigned to more than two workshops across all time slots.

#### 4. Topic-Specific Constraints
*   **DevOps Temporal Restriction:** Any workshop $w$ assigned the **DevOps** topic must be scheduled in the **Midday** time slot.
*   **Data Spatial Restriction:** Any workshop $w$ assigned the **Data** topic must not be assigned to **Room 3**.
*   **UI-Data Mutual Exclusion:** Workshops assigned the **UI** topic and workshops assigned the **Data** topic are prohibited from occurring in the same time slot $s$, regardless of room assignment. 

#### 5. Objective Function
*   **Efficiency Maximization:** The schedule must be constructed to minimize the number of unused room-time slots. 
    *   *Note: Given $|W| = 6$ and total available slots $|S \times R| = 9$, the system must prioritize a valid distribution that adheres to the Room Utilization Cap while ensuring all 6 workshops are allocated.*

#### 6. Formal Verification Criteria
A schedule is considered "Valid" if and only if:
1.  All six workshops are assigned to valid $(s, r)$ coordinates.
2.  The set of topics $\{Topic(w) \mid w \in W\}$ is equivalent to $T$.
3.  All constraints defined in Sections 3 and 4 are satisfied with zero violations.
