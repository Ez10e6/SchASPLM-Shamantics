### System Specification: Training Session Scheduling

**1. System Entities and Domains**
*   **Sessions ($S$):** A set of four discrete training sessions $\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}$.
*   **Topics ($T$):** {Networking, Security}.
*   **Time Slots ($TS$):** {Morning, Afternoon}.
*   **Rooms ($R$):** {Room 1, Room 2}.

**2. Objective**
Assign each session $s \in S$ a unique combination of $(r, ts)$, where $r \in R$ and $ts \in TS$, such that all sessions are scheduled and all domain constraints are satisfied.

**3. Allocation Constraints**
*   **Completeness:** Every session $s \in S$ must be assigned exactly one Room and one Time Slot.
*   **Exclusivity:** No two sessions may share the same Room and Time Slot simultaneously. 
*   **Capacity:** Total session count $|S|$ must equal the total available resource slots ($|R| \times |TS| = 4$).
*   **Bijective Mapping:** The assignment function $f: S \to (R \times TS)$ must be a bijection, ensuring 100% utilization of available space-time coordinates with no overlaps.

**4. Topic-Specific Constraints**
*   **Security Session Temporal Constraint:**
    *   If $Topic(s) = \text{Security}$, then $TimeSlot(s) = \text{Afternoon}$.
*   **Networking Session Spatial Constraint:**
    *   If $Topic(s) = \text{Networking}$, then $Room(s) \neq \text{Room 1}$ (Session must be assigned to Room 2).

**5. Operational Requirements**
*   All scheduling must be contained within a single operational day.
*   The system must validate that the distribution of session topics (Networking vs. Security) allows for a feasible solution given the constraints in Section 4.
