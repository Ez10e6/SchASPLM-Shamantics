I’ve been working on the schedule for our upcoming training day, and I wanted to walk you through how we need to organize the four sessions we have planned. Each of these sessions is focused on one of two specific tracks: they will either cover Networking or Security. 

We are fitting everything into a single day, utilizing both the morning and the afternoon time slots across our two available rooms. Because we have exactly four sessions to get through, every single one must be assigned to a specific room and time slot to ensure nothing is left out. As you might expect, we have to respect the capacity of our space, meaning each room can only host one session at a time; we can't have two sessions running in the same room during the same time block.

There are also a couple of specific requirements regarding the topics that we need to keep in mind while we’re booking the space. First, any session that covers Security must be held in the afternoon, so we cannot schedule those for the morning. Additionally, we’ve been informed that all Networking sessions have to be held somewhere other than Room 1, so those will need to be placed accordingly. If we follow those rules, we should have a perfectly balanced schedule for the day.
