I’ve been working on the schedule for those five upcoming lectures, and I wanted to walk you through the logistics because it’s a bit of a puzzle. Each of these five sessions focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Physics. To get everything organized, we have two time slots available throughout the day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—and we’ve been allocated three different rooms to use.

The main objective is to ensure that every single lecture is assigned to a room and a specific time slot without skipping any sessions or accidentally duplicating them. Naturally, we have to be careful about space, so each room can only host a maximum of one lecture per time slot to avoid any double-booking. 

There is one specific restriction from the department that we have to follow closely regarding how we use the rooms. It turns out that Mathematics and Physics lectures are not permitted to take place in the same room at all. Even if a Math lecture is held in the morning and a Physics lecture is scheduled for the afternoon, they still cannot share the same physical space. We’ll need to keep that in mind as we figure out where to place the AI sessions and how to split up the rest of the schedule.
