Imagine we are looking at a complex distribution network designed to move goods from a central warehouse to a main delivery hub. The network is made up of several transit points connected by one-way shipping routes, where each specific route has a strictly defined maximum capacity that we simply cannot exceed. Our objective is to coordinate the logistics so that we push the absolute highest volume of goods possible from the starting warehouse to the final delivery hub. 

To make this work, we have to follow a couple of fundamental rules. First, we must ensure that the amount of cargo assigned to any individual route stays within its rated capacity to avoid bottlenecks or system failures. Second, we have to maintain a perfect balance at every single transit point situated between the warehouse and the hub. This means that for every intermediate stop, the total amount of goods arriving from various routes must exactly match the total amount being sent back out, ensuring that no inventory is lost or left sitting at these mid-way locations.
