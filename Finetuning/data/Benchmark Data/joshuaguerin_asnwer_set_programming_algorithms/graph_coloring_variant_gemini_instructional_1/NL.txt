### Specification: Minimum Vertex Coloring Optimization

**1. System Definition**
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph where:
*   $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ represents a finite set of **vertices** (nodes).
*   $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ represents a set of **edges** (connections) between distinct vertices.

**2. Objective**
Identify the **chromatic number** $\chi(G)$, defined as the minimum cardinality of the set of colors $C$ required to produce a valid vertex coloring.
*   **Minimize:** $k = |C|$, where $C = \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$.

**3. Functional Constraints**
The system must satisfy the following logical requirements:
*   **Discrete Mapping:** Assign exactly one color $c(i) \in C$ to each vertex $v_i \in V$.
*   **Adjacency Constraint:** For every edge $\{u, v\} \in E$, the condition $c(u) \neq c(v)$ must hold.
*   **Non-Negativity:** The number of colors $k$ must be a positive integer such that $1 \leq k \leq |V|$.

**4. Execution Requirements**
*   **Input:** Accept a structured representation of the graph $G$ (e.g., adjacency matrix or adjacency list).
*   **Verification:** Validate that no two adjacent vertices are assigned identical color indices.
*   **Optimization:** Iterate or compute to ensure that no valid coloring exists for any $k' < k$.

**5. Output Specification**
The system shall return:
*   The optimal value $\chi(G)$.
*   An assignment vector $A = [c(v_1), c(v_2), \dots, c(v_n)]$ mapping each vertex to its assigned color index.
