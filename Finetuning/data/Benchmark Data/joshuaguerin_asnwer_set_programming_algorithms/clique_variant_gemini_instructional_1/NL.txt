### Problem Specification: Maximum Clique (MC) Optimization

#### 1. System Definition
Define an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ as the primary data structure, where:
*   $V$ is a finite set of vertices (nodes).
*   $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$ is a set of unordered pairs representing undirected edges.

#### 2. Objective
Identify a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ that constitutes a **Maximum Clique**. The system must satisfy the dual requirements of structural completeness and cardinality maximization.

#### 3. Functional Constraints
To qualify as a valid solution, the subset $S$ must adhere to the following logic:
*   **Completeness (Clique Property):** For every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \in S$, there must exist an edge $\{u, v\} \in E$.
*   **Induced Subgraph Integrity:** The subgraph $G[S]$ induced by the subset $S$ must be a complete graph (each vertex is adjacent to all other vertices in the subset).
*   **Vertex Uniqueness:** The selection process must treat all vertices in $S$ as distinct entities.

#### 4. Operational Requirements
The implementation must execute the following operations:
*   **Search:** Traverse the vertex space $V$ to evaluate potential candidate subsets.
*   **Verification:** Validate that every selected node pair within a candidate subset $S$ is represented in the edge set $E$.
*   **Optimization:** Apply an objective function to maximize the cardinality of the subset:
    $$\text{Maximize } z = |S|$$
    $$\text{Subject to: } \forall u, v \in S, u \neq v \implies \{u, v\} \in E$$

#### 5. Output Specification
*   **Primary Output:** The subset $S^* \subseteq V$ that yields the highest possible integer value for $|S^*|$.
*   **Optimality Proof:** Ensure that no subset $S' \subseteq V$ exists such that $S'$ is a clique and $|S'| > |S^*|$.
