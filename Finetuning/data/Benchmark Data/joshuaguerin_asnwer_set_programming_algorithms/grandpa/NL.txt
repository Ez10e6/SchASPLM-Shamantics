You are tasked with defining family relationship rules to verify a specific logical paradox (becoming one's own grandfather).
The input consists of facts about individuals, including their gender, parentage relationships, and marriage status.

The objective is to infer extended family relationships based on the following rules:
1. Marriage is a symmetric relationship; if X is married to Y, then Y is married to X.
2. Siblings are defined as distinct individuals who share at least one parent.
3. Stepparents are treated as parents: if someone is married to a child's parent, they are also considered a parent of that child.
4. An uncle is defined as a male sibling of a parent.
5. A grandparent is defined as a parent of a parent.
6. A "grandpa" is specifically defined here as a male individual who is a grandparent of themselves.

The goal is to determine if any individual satisfies the condition of being their own grandpa.
