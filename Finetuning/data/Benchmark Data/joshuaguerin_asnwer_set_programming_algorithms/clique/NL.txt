You are tasked with solving the Maximum Clique problem on an undirected graph.
The input consists of a set of nodes and edges connecting them.

The objective is to select a subgraph that is "complete," meaning every pair of distinct vertices in the subset is connected by an edge.
To find the optimal solution, you must maximize the total number of nodes in this complete subgraph.
