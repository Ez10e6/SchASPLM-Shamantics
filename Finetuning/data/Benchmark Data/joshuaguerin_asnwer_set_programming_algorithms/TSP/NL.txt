You are tasked with solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) on an undirected graph. 
The graph consists of a set of nodes and weighted edges. 
You are given a specific start node 's' and an end node 'e'. 
The objective is to find a path from the start node to the end node such that:
1. The path forms a Hamiltonian Path, meaning every node in the graph is visited exactly once.
2. The total cost (sum of weights) of the edges in the path is minimized.

The solution should output the selected edges that form this optimal path.
