Edges are symmetric (undirected).
Generate a set of path edges from the available edges.
Each node must have at most one incoming edge in the path.
Each node must have at most one outgoing edge in the path.
The start node must not have any incoming edges.
The end node must not have any outgoing edges.
Define reachability: the start node is reachable, and any node connected to a reachable node via a path edge is reachable.
The end node must be reachable from the start.
All nodes in the graph must be reachable (Hamiltonian property).
Minimize the total cost of the selected path edges.
Output the path predicate.
