You are tasked with solving the Bin Packing optimization problem.
The input consists of a set of items, each with a specific cost (or weight), and a maximum capacity 'n' for the bins.

The objective is to assign every item to a bin.
The assignment must satisfy the condition that the sum of the costs of items in any single bin does not exceed the capacity 'n'.
To find the optimal solution, you must minimize the total number of bins used.
