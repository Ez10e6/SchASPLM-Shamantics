You are tasked with solving the Minimum Vertex Cover problem on a graph.
The input consists of a set of nodes and edges connecting them.

The objective is to select a subset of nodes (the "cover") such that every edge in the graph is connected to at least one selected node.
To find the optimal solution, you must minimize the total number of nodes in this cover.
