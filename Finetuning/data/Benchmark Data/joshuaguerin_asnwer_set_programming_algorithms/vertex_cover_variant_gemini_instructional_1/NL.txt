### System Specification: Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) Optimization

**1. System Context**
The objective is to identify a vertex subset of minimum cardinality that satisfies the edge coverage requirement for a given undirected graph.

**2. Input Definitions**
*   **Graph ($G$):** Defined as a pair $(V, E)$.
*   **Vertex Set ($V$):** A finite set of discrete nodes $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$.
*   **Edge Set ($E$):** A set of unordered pairs $\{u, v\}$ such that $u, v \in V$ and $u \neq v$, representing a connection between two distinct nodes.

**3. Output Specification**
*   **Vertex Cover ($C$):** A subset of the vertex set ($C \subseteq V$) that satisfies all defined constraints.

**4. Constraints**
*   **Edge Coverage Constraint:** For every edge $e \in E$, where $e = \{u, v\}$, the intersection of the edge components and the vertex cover must be non-empty ($e \cap C \neq \emptyset$).
    *   *Formal Logic:* $\forall \{u, v\} \in E : (u \in C) \lor (v \in C)$.
*   **Subset Integrity:** The solution set $C$ must exclusively contain elements present in the input set $V$.

**5. Optimization Objective**
*   **Minimize Cardinality:** The primary objective is to minimize the total number of nodes included in the cover set $C$.
    *   *Objective Function:* $\min |C|$.

**6. Execution Requirements**
*   **Search Space:** Evaluate the power set $\mathcal{P}(V)$ to identify subsets that satisfy the Edge Coverage Constraint.
*   **Optimality:** Ensure that no subset $C' \subseteq V$ exists such that $C'$ is a valid vertex cover and $|C'| < |C|$.
