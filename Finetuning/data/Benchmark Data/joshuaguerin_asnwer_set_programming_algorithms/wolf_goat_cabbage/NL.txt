A farmer needs to transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. 
They start on the left bank and must reach the right bank within a specific number of time steps. 
The boat is small: it can only hold the farmer and one item (or the farmer can row alone). 
The farmer must always be in the boat to row. 

There are safety constraints:
1. If the wolf is left alone with the goat (without the farmer), the wolf will eat the goat.
2. If the goat is left alone with the cabbage (without the farmer), the goat will eat the cabbage.

Find a valid sequence of crossings that gets everyone to the other side safely.
