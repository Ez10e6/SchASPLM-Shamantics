You are managing a Relay Race Event. You need to calculate the schedule metrics and optimize the assignments based on runner preferences.

The input provides the `leg` definitions (start/end points), `distance` between points, and the `participant` list.
The `assignment` of participants to legs is given (or generated). Your task is to:
1. Define helper predicates to track who runs which leg index.
2. Identify where each participant starts and ends their relay portion (exchanges).
3. Calculate the duration of each leg based on the runner's pace.
4. Calculate the total distance, ascent, and descent for each participant.
5. Apply optimization objectives to:
    - Minimize the difference between a runner's preferred distance and their actual distance.
    - Minimize the total duration of the race.
    - Minimize the number of runner exchanges (handoffs).
    - Minimize the difference between actual pace and preferred pace.
