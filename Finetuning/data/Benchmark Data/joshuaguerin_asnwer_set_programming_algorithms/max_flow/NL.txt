You are tasked with solving the Maximum Flow problem on a directed graph.
The input consists of a set of nodes, edges with associated capacities, a specific start node, and a terminal node.

The objective is to determine the amount of flow to assign to each edge to maximize the total flow reaching the terminal node.
The solution must satisfy two main conditions:
1. The flow on any specific edge cannot exceed that edge's capacity.
2. For every node except the start and terminal nodes, the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow (flow conservation).
