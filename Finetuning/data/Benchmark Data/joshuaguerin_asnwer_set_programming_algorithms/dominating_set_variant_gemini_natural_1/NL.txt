Imagine we have a collection of specific integer values that we need to organize into two distinct piles, which we will call subset 'a' and subset 'b'. The goal here is to achieve a perfect balance between the two. As you work through the set, you must ensure that every single value is accounted for and assigned to a group. It is vital that no number is left behind and, conversely, that no number is placed into both groups at once; each value must belong to exactly one subset.

The real challenge lies in the final totals. We need the sum of all the integers in subset 'a' to be exactly equal to the total sum of the integers in subset 'b'. It is a precise matching game where the two sides must carry the same weight. When you have finished sorting the values to meet these requirements, your final task is simply to provide a clear breakdown showing which specific numbers have been assigned to each of the two subsets.
