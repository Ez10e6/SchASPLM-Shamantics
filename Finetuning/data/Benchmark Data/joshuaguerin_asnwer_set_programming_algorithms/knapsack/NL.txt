You are tasked with solving the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
The input consists of a set of items, where each item has a specific value and a weight, and a maximum capacity 'n' for the knapsack.

The objective is to select a subset of these items to maximize the total value.
The selection must satisfy the constraint that the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the capacity 'n'.
