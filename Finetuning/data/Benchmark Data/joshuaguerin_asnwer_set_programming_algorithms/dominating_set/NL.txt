You are tasked with solving the Equal Sum Partition problem.
The input consists of a set of integer values.

The objective is to partition this set of values into two distinct subsets, labeled 'a' and 'b'.
The partition must satisfy two conditions:
1. Every value from the input set must belong to exactly one of the two subsets.
2. The sum of the values in subset 'a' must be exactly equal to the sum of the values in subset 'b'.

The output should identify which values belong to which subset.
