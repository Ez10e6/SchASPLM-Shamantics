Imagine we are overseeing a high-tech warehouse facility laid out on a vast two-dimensional grid. Our floor is a buzz of activity, populated by a fleet of autonomous robots, rows of heavy-duty shelves, and several fixed picking stations. Each shelf is stocked with a specific inventory of products, and our primary goal is to clear a backlog of customer orders within a strictly defined time window.

To fulfill these orders, the robots must execute a precise sequence of tasks. A robot begins by navigating the grid to locate a specific shelf that contains the products requested by a customer. Once it reaches the shelf, the robot must lift it and transport it across the warehouse to a designated picking station. After the required quantity of goods is delivered at the station, the robot is responsible for hauling the shelf back to a storage area or leaving it at a valid spot on the grid before moving on to its next task.

However, the warehouse is a complex environment with strict operational rules that every robot must follow. Movement is limited to the four cardinal directions—North, South, East, and West—and the robots must navigate carefully to avoid any accidents. We cannot have two robots occupying the same grid square at once, nor can they attempt to swap positions with one another in a single move, as these collisions would shut down the entire operation. 

There are also physical constraints on how the robots interact with the inventory. A single robot is only strong enough to carry one shelf at a time, and conversely, a shelf is designed to be moved by only one robot at a time. The robots are also limited by their immediate surroundings; a robot can only initiate a pickup or a putdown action if it is positioned at the exact same grid coordinate as the shelf. Furthermore, the actual delivery of products can only occur when a robot is physically present at a picking station while carrying the appropriate shelf. To successfully manage this logistics challenge, we must produce a complete, synchronized itinerary for every robot, detailing every move, lift, delivery, and drop-off required to satisfy our customers on time.
