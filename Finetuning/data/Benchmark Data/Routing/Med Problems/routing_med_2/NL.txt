A water‑sampling drone is launched from the LaunchPad into a branching 
network of subterranean aqueducts. It must collect samples at StationA 
and StationB, but can optionally sample at StationC if time allows. 
The aqueducts are one‑way tunnels, each carrying a distinct water volume 
cost that reduces the drone’s internal tank capacity (max 16 L). Moving 
through any tunnel takes exactly 1 minute, and collecting a sample at a 
station requires 1 minute and fills 1 L.
From LaunchPad, two connectors diverge: Tunnel1 (cost 2 L) and Tunnel2 
(cost 3 L). Tunnel1 leads to StationA (1 L), then onward to Tunnel3 
(1 L) which loops back to Tunnel2. Tunnel2 goes to StationB (1 L) or to 
a calibration shaft CalibEdge (2 L), which itself permits entry into 
StationC (1 L). StationC then funnels back to Tunnel1 at heavier volume 
cost (2 L).
The drone begins with a full 16 L tank at time 0 and must operate within 
10 minutes. It cannot exceed its tank capacity. It may refill 3 L by 
idling 2 consecutive minutes at CalibEdge, but only once. The mission 
requires at least one sample at StationA and StationB, with StationA’s 
sample completed by minute 6. StationC must only be sampled if and only 
if both mandatory samples finish within 8 minutes. The total count of 
movements, samplings, and refills must not exceed 18 events. The 
drone may never sample twice in a row at the same station (to avoid 
cross‑contamination). Primary objective: maximize the total number of 
samples (including optional). Secondary: minimize the time at which the 
last mandatory sample completes.
