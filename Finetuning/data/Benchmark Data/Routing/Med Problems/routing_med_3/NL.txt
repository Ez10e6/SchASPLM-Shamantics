A maintenance rover operates in a rugged terrain with several sensor outposts.
It begins its route at BaseCamp and is required to inspect OutpostX and OutpostY
exactly once. Additionally, the rover may choose to inspect RelayStation to gather
bonus diagnostic data, but this is optional. Movement between adjacent locations
takes 1 minute, and each inspection requires a full minute of stationary scanning.
The terrain is energy-intensive: each movement consumes 1 unit of battery, and the
rover starts with only 6 units. The inspection at RelayStation offers a diagnostic
reward, but only if all mandatory inspections are completed with more than two battery
units remaining. The map is as follows: BaseCamp connects to Fork1 and Fork2. Fork1
connects to OutpostX and RelayStation. Fork2 connects to OutpostY and RelayStation. 
The maximum time taken can not be more than 10 minutes.
