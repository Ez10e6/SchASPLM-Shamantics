A mobile inspection drone must visit a series of facilities distributed across an
industrial site. The drone begins at Station1 and is required to inspect both
SubstationA and SubstationB at least once during its route. Movement between facilities
takes 1kJ of energy, and inspections require another 1kJ. The map layout
consists of the following connections: Station1 is adjacent to Junction1 and
Junction2. Junction1 connects to SubstationA, while Junction2 connects to SubstationB.
In addition, Junction1 and Junction2 are directly connected. The drone has 8kJ
in total to complete the route. However, energy efficiency is a concern—among all valid
routes, the one with the lowest power usage by the time inspections are complete (including both
movement and inspection) is preferred. Also, if the drone visits Junction2 before 
SubstationA, it must not backtrack through Junction1 to reach SubstationA due to signal
interference.
