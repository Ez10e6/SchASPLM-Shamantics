An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is deployed from a **Docking Bay** to service a remote sensory grid. To complete its primary mission, the AUV must conduct a single scanning operation at both **Buoy Alpha** and **Buoy Beta**. A **Central Hub** is also available for a secondary diagnostic scan, though this task is not compulsory. 

Traversing the distance between any two connected nodes drains 1 unit of the AUV’s 6-unit power supply and consumes 1 minute of time. Every scanning procedure requires the vehicle to remain stationary for exactly 1 minute. The diagnostic reward at the Central Hub is only granted if both mandatory buoys are serviced while the power reserve remains strictly above 2 units. 

The grid layout is as follows: 
*   The **Docking Bay** links to **Waypoint 1** and **Waypoint 2**. 
*   **Waypoint 1** provides paths to **Buoy Alpha** and the **Central Hub**. 
*   **Waypoint 2** provides paths to **Buoy Beta** and the **Central Hub**. 

The entire mission duration is strictly capped at 10 minutes.
