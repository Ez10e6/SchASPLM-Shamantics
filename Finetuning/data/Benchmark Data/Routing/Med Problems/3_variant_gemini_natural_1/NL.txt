Our maintenance rover is currently stationed at BaseCamp, ready to begin its circuit through the rugged terrain of the sensor network. The primary mission objective is to conduct a thorough inspection of both OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once. While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.

Navigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover’s limited six-unit battery. Furthermore, once the rover arrives at a destination, it must remain stationary for a full minute to complete its scanning sequence. The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation. Similarly, Fork2 provides a path to OutpostY as well as an alternate route to the RelayStation.

There is a specific incentive for efficiency regarding the optional RelayStation visit. The diagnostic reward offered there is only granted if the rover manages to complete both mandatory inspections at OutpostX and OutpostY while still having more than two units of battery power remaining in its reserves. Finally, the entire operation must be executed with precision, as the rover is required to complete its full route and all chosen tasks within a strict ten-minute window.
