Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC.
Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):
    LaunchPad → Tunnel1 (2)
    LaunchPad → Tunnel2 (3)
    Tunnel1 → StationA (1)
    StationA → Tunnel3 (1)
    Tunnel3 → Tunnel2 (1)
    Tunnel2 → StationB (1)
    Tunnel2 → CalibEdge (2)
    CalibEdge → StationC (1)
    StationC → Tunnel1 (2).
10 minutes maximum time.
Start at launchpad.
Movement: 1 min per edge.
Sampling: 1 min, +1 L per sample.
Tank Capacity: 16 L.
Refill at CalibEdge, 2 min idle refilling capacity by 3L (at most once).
Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB.
StationA sampled by time 6.
StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute 8.
Event Limit: ≤ 18 events (moves + samples + refill).
No consecutive samples at same station.
Primary: maximize #samples.
Secondary: minimize max completion time of StationA & StationB.
