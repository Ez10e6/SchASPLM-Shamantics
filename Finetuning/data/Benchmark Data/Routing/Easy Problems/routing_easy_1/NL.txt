A delivery robot operates on a small grid. It begins at location A and must deliver
packages to a few nearby sites. The robot can move from one location to an adjacent
location if they are connected. There are five locations in total: A, B, C, D, and E.
The map layout is as follows: A connects to B and C, B connects to D, and C connects to 
E. The robot has 6 minutes to deliver the packages and each movement takes one minute. 
The robot must deliver packages to D and E, visiting each only once. It can choose 
the order.
