Within a complex comprising five zones labeled A through E, a service drone is stationed at point A. Its mission requires it to provide maintenance to both zone C and zone E. The facility’s layout only permits direct passage between specific pairs: A is linked to B and D, B connects to C, and D leads to E. With a strict energy limit of 6 total steps—each step representing one unit of time—the drone must navigate these pathways. Starting from A, the drone can transition to any bordering zone at each interval until its 6-move quota is exhausted, ensuring both target zones are visited at least once.
