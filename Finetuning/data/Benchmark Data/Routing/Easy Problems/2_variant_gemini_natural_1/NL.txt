Imagine we are deploying a drone from the central hub at headquarters, which we’ve designated as point 1, to conduct a specialized scanning mission across a small network of four locations. The layout of this network is quite specific: from our starting position at point 1, the drone can fly directly to either point 2 or point 3, but point 4 is a bit more isolated and can only be reached by traveling through point 2. Because of the way the navigation system is programmed, the drone is strictly limited to moving between these directly adjacent locations.

The mission objective is to ensure that both point 3 and point 4 are scanned during the flight, though the drone operator can decide which of those two targets to visit first. Timing is the most rigid part of this operation; the drone’s flight path must last for exactly five time units. Since every single move from one point to the next consumes exactly one unit of time, the drone will need to make a total of five hops across the network. The mission begins at point 1, and the drone must navigate the connections efficiently enough to cover both required scan sites within that precise five-move window.
