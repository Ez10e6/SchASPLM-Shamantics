An automated courier is stationed at terminal A within a five-node network (A, B, C, D, and E). Its objective is to fulfill delivery requirements at two specific sites, D and E, visiting each destination exactly once in any preferred sequence. The navigational paths are restricted to the following connections: terminal A is linked to nodes B and C; node B bridges to site D; and node C bridges to site E. Every traversal between two connected points requires a one-minute duration. The courier must complete the entire delivery mission within a strict six-minute timeframe.
