Imagine you are overseeing our new delivery robot as it begins its shift at the central hub, known as location A. The robot’s task is to navigate a small grid of five interconnected sites to drop off packages at two specific destinations: D and E. The map is designed such that the robot can only move between adjacent points that have a direct connection. From its starting position at A, the robot can transition directly to either location B or location C. If it moves to B, it then gains access to location D; similarly, if it travels to C, it can then reach location E.

The clock is ticking on this delivery run, as the robot must complete its entire mission within a strict six-minute window. Every single movement from one location to an adjacent one consumes exactly one minute of its battery life. To successfully fulfill its orders, the robot must make an appearance at both location D and location E, though it is only required to visit each of these two sites once. We have given the robot the flexibility to decide which delivery to prioritize, meaning it can choose to head toward D first or E first, provided it manages to navigate the connections and finish the job before its time runs out.
