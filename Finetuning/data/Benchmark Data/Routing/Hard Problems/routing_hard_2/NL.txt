An autonomous rover is tasked with collecting critical samples in a subterranean Mars base tunnel network. The mission
begins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and
hydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and 
stations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.
From the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water 
respectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming 
an additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can 
move through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly 
to Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC 
(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.
The rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a 
time-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly—requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a 
potential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must 
be taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate 
that StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.
Each sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced 
filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive 
samples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.
The CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive 
minutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be 
accessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.
Movement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the 
designated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total 
events—including movements, sampling operations, and water refills—to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.
The primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations. If multiple route 
plans achieve the same sample count, priority should be given to the plan that completes the mandatory sampling 
operations (StationA and StationB) in the least amount of time.
