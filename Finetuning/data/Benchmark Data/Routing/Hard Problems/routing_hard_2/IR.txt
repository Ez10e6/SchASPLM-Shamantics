Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC.
Directed Edges and Water Costs:
    LaunchPad → Tunnel1 (2 liters)
    LaunchPad → Tunnel2 (3 liters)
    Tunnel1 → StationA (1 liter)
    StationA → Tunnel3 (1 liter)
    Tunnel3 → Tunnel2 (1 liter)
    Tunnel2 → StationB (1 liter)
    Tunnel2 → CalibEdge (2 liters)
    CalibEdge → StationC (1 liter)
    StationC → Tunnel1 (2 liters)
The rover starts at LaunchPad at time 0.
The maximum timeframe is 10 minutes.
Movement is only possible along directed edges.
Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute.
The rover has a water tank with 16 liter capacity.
Mandatory sampling sites: StationA and StationB (exactly once each).
Optional sampling site: StationC.
StationA must be sampled by time 6.
Taking a sample requires 1 minute and recovers 1 liter of water.
The rover can refill 3 liters of water by spending 2 minutes at CalibEdge (at most once).
The total number of events (moves, samples, refill) must not exceed 18.
The rover cannot take consecutive samples at the same location.
StationC must be sampled if and only if both mandatory sites are sampled by minute 8.
Primary objective: maximize the number of samples taken.
Secondary objective: minimize the latest time at which a mandatory sample is taken.
