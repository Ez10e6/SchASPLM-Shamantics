An autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority
surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight
corridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference
shielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take
one minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route
via either the eastern or western outbound lanes—PathA and PathB—requiring 2 and 3 
attery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.
Once on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 
nits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access
to TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at
just 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,
though doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may
proceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the
restricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies
deeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. 
TowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump
imposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude
gain.
The mission begins at time zero.
While movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires
the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal
acquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful
scan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection
protocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is
considered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.
The drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all
scanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,
capped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone’s
movements must not exceed this capacity.
To accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle
at MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,
this recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever
visits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following
minute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.
For mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number
of tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield
the same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each 
mandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit
consecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating.
