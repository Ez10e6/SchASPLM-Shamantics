Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ.
Directed Edges and Movement Costs:
    CommandCenter → PathA (2 battery)
    CommandCenter → PathB (3 battery)
    PathA → TowerX (2 battery)
    PathB → TowerY (2 battery)
    PathB → PathA (1 battery)
    TowerX → PathB (2 battery)
    TowerY → MidRelay (3 battery)
    MidRelay → TowerZ (2 battery)
    TowerZ → TowerX (4 battery).
The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0.
Movement is only possible along directed edges.
Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute.
Scans take 2 full minutes.
The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once.
TowerX must be scanned by time 5.
TowerZ can be scanned optionally.
The total number of location visits must not exceed 20.
The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units.
If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep.
Maximise the number of scans performed.
As a secondary priority minimize the time by which the mandatory sites are scanned at least once.
The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location.
The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay.
