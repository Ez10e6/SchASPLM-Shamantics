A marine survey drone emerges from SubDock into a labyrinth of 
undersea currents that define a bidirectional routing graph. 
Each current lane exacts a heat load on the drone’s systems rather than 
battery measured in heat units and all traversals take one time unit. 
The drone starts with a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units; every movement 
along a lane adds its heat load, and it can shed all heat by lingering in 
a cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.
From SubDock, the drone may navigate the gentle CoralPass (2 units) or the 
turbulent VentStream (4 units). CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1 unit) or 
loops via DeepLoop (1 unit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly 
to BeaconBeta (2 units) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1 unit), which branches 
to BeaconGamma (3 units). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down‑draft 
conduit back to BeaconAlpha (4 units).
At each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that 
requires 2 minutes and raises heat by 1 unit for data calibration. The 
mission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be 
pulsed before minute 5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all 
mandatory pulses are finised within 8 minutes.
No more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. 
If NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or 
perform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the 
heat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream
are forbidden to avoid signal overlap. The aim which is primary in choosing one 
of multiple possibe routes must be to avoid wasting time, that is time at which the
drone is not performing an acoustic pulse at any survey location.
