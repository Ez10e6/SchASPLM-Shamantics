Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma.
Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:
    SubDock - CoralPass (2)
    SubDock - VentStream (4)
    CoralPass - BeaconAlpha (1)
    CoralPass - DeepLoop (1)
    DeepLoop - VentStream (1)
    VentStream - BeaconBeta (2)
    VentStream - NodeX (1)
    NodeX - BeaconGamma (3)
    BeaconGamma - BeaconAlpha (4)
Heat Tolerance: max 10 units.
Movement takes 1 min, heat increases per edge.
Pulsing takes 2 minutes and increases heat by 1.
Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional.
BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time 5.
Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute 8.
Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2 min and reduce heat to 0.
When at NodeX next action must be either pulse or cooldown.
Action Limit: ≤ 16 (moves + pulses + cooldowns).
Must visit VentStream between each pulsing.
Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing.
