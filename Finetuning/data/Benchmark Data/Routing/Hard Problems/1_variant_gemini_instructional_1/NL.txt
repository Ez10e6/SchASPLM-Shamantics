### **Autonomous Surveillance Mission Specification**

#### **1. System Architecture and Topology**
The mission environment is modeled as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents nodes (locations) and $E$ represents flight corridors (transitions).

**1.1 Nodes ($V$):**
*   **CommandCenter (CC):** Mission origin.
*   **PathA (PA), PathB (PB):** Intermediate transit waypoints.
*   **TowerX (TX), TowerY (TY):** Primary surveillance objectives.
*   **MidRelay (MR):** Power restoration and relay node.
*   **TowerZ (TZ):** Auxiliary surveillance objective.

**1.2 Directed Edges and Energy Costs ($E$):**
*   $(CC \to PA):$ 2 units
*   $(CC \to PB):$ 3 units
*   $(PA \to TX):$ 2 units
*   $(PB \to TY):$ 2 units
*   $(PB \to PA):$ 1 unit
*   $(TX \to PB):$ 2 units
*   $(TY \to MR):$ 3 units
*   $(MR \to TZ):$ 2 units
*   $(TZ \to TX):$ 4 units

#### **2. Operational Parameters**
*   **Temporal Unit:** All traversals between nodes consume exactly 1 minute.
*   **Initial State:** $T = 0$; Battery $= 14$ units; Location $= CC$.
*   **Resource Ceiling:** Maximum battery capacity is capped at 14 units.
*   **Scanning Protocol:** 
    *   A scan requires the drone to remain stationary at a Tower node ($TX, TY, TZ$) for 2 consecutive minutes.
    *   Scanning is prohibited at non-tower nodes.
    *   Consecutive scans at the same node are prohibited (no redundant data acquisition).
*   **Mission Endurance:** Total actions (moves and stationary minutes) must not exceed 20 increments.

#### **3. Constraints and Logic**
*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The drone must successfully complete at least one 2-minute scan at both **TowerX** and **TowerY**.
*   **Temporal Deadline:** The scan at **TowerX** must be completed (finalized) by $T \le 5$.
*   **Auxiliary Objective:** A scan at **TowerZ** is optional but contributes to the mission score.
*   **MidRelay Recovery Protocol:**
    *   The drone may idle at **MidRelay** for exactly 2 consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units.
    *   If the drone enters **MidRelay**, the subsequent move must be to **TowerZ** in the immediately following minute.
*   **Energy Constraint:** The cumulative energy cost of all traversals must not exceed the current battery level. The drone cannot execute a move if the cost exceeds available power.

#### **4. Optimization Objectives**
The system shall evaluate valid flight paths based on the following hierarchical priorities:

1.  **Primary Objective:** Maximize the total count of completed tower scans ($TX, TY, TZ$).
2.  **Secondary Objective:** In the event of a tie in total scans, minimize the time ($T$) at which the final mandatory scan (at either $TX$ or $TY$) is completed.

#### **5. Execution Constraints**
*   **Pathing:** The drone must strictly follow the directional links defined in Section 1.2.
*   **Battery Management:** Battery replenishment at **MidRelay** cannot exceed the 14-unit maximum capacity.
*   **Stationary Actions:** Only scanning and the defined **MidRelay** idle period permit the drone to remain at a node for more than the 1-minute traversal time.
