An autonomous submersible departs from its primary Launch Bay into a network of undersea corridors. These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit’s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.

From the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).

At each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.

The mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile. When choosing between valid routes, the primary objective is to minimize "inactive time"—defined as any time spent on transits or cooldowns rather than on acoustic calibrations.
