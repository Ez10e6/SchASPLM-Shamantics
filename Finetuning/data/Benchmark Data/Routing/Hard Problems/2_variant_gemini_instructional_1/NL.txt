### **System Specification: Autonomous Subterranean Exploration Rover**

#### **1. Operational Environment and Topology**
The mission environment is a directed graph consisting of nodes (locations) and edges (tunnels). Movement between any two nodes consumes exactly **1 minute** of mission time.

*   **Nodes:** {LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, Tunnel3, StationA, StationB, StationC, CalibEdge}.
*   **Edge Connectivity and Resource Costs:**
    *   **LaunchPad → Tunnel1:** 2 liters water.
    *   **LaunchPad → Tunnel2:** 3 liters water.
    *   **Tunnel1 → StationA:** 1 liter water.
    *   **StationA → Tunnel3:** 1 liter water.
    *   **Tunnel3 → Tunnel2:** 0 liters water.
    *   **Tunnel2 → StationB:** 1 liter water.
    *   **Tunnel2 → CalibEdge:** 2 liters water.
    *   **CalibEdge → StationC:** 1 liter water.
    *   **StationC → Tunnel1:** 2 liters water.

#### **2. Initial State**
*   **Deployment Location:** LaunchPad.
*   **Initial Water Inventory ($W$):** 16 liters.
*   **Elapsed Time ($T$):** 0 minutes.
*   **Event Counter ($E$):** 0.
*   **Sample Inventory ($S$):** $\emptyset$.

#### **3. Transitional Constraints**
*   **Temporal Limit:** Total mission time $T$ must not exceed **10 minutes**.
*   **Resource Integrity:** Water inventory $W$ must remain $\ge 0$ at all times.
*   **Event Limit:** Total discrete events $E$ (movements, sampling, and refills) must not exceed **18**.
*   **Directionality:** Traversal is strictly limited to the specified directions between nodes.

#### **4. Operational Actions**
*   **Sampling Operations:**
    *   **Duration:** 1 minute per operation.
    *   **Resource Recovery:** +1 liter water (recovered from substrate).
    *   **Protocol:** No two consecutive sampling operations may occur at the same station.
*   **Water Replenishment (CalibEdge):**
    *   **Duration:** 2 consecutive minutes.
    *   **Resource Gain:** +3 liters water.
    *   **Frequency:** Maximum of one replenishment operation per mission.

#### **5. Mission Objectives and Sampling Logic**
*   **Primary Samples (Mandatory):**
    *   **StationA:** Must be sampled exactly once. Collection must be completed by $T \le 6$.
    *   **StationB:** Must be sampled exactly once.
*   **Secondary Samples (Conditional):**
    *   **StationC:** Must be sampled if and only if both StationA and StationB have been sampled within the first **8 minutes** ($T \le 8$). If this condition is not met, StationC sampling is non-essential.
*   **Optimization Hierarchy:**
    1.  **Maximize $N$:** Total number of unique samples collected.
    2.  **Minimize $T_{mandatory}$:** If $N$ is equal across plans, select the plan with the lowest time for completing both mandatory samples (StationA and StationB).

#### **6. Execution Rules**
*   The rover must navigate the network while adhering to the cooling/hydraulic costs associated with each tunnel and station entry.
*   Every movement between nodes, every 1-minute sampling operation, and every 2-minute refill sequence counts as a discrete event toward the total event limit $E$.
*   The mission terminates immediately upon $T = 10$, $E = 18$, or the completion of the optimization goals.
