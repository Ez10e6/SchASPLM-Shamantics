You’ve been tasked with laying out a rich three‑day symposium featuring twelve
workshops in four disciplines — Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Mathematics,
and Linguistics — across a venue with four rooms. Each day unfolds in three
sessions — morning, midday, and evening — and every workshop must claim at least 
one room–time slot without any double‑booking.
To keep things balanced, no room may see more than two workshops per day, and
they can’t be back‑to‑back; a break must separate any two uses of the same room.
Also, Room 2 goes dark at evening, while Room 4’s limited capacity rules out
any AI or Physics sessions there.
Your thematic requirements narrow the field further: AI workshops belong
exclusively in morning sessions, and Physics must stay on Day 1 or Day 2, never
spilling into the final day. All Mathematics workshops must settle into either
Room 1 or Room 3, whereas Linguistics sessions need their own moments—no two
may ever run concurrently.
Another wrinkle: each room should host only one discipline per day, so you can’t
mix topics under the same roof in a single day. To guarantee breadth, you’ll
include at least one workshop from each of the four fields every day. For a 
neat bookend, the very first workshop must be an AI presentation, 
and the closing workshop must be a Linguistics talk.
Beyond satisfying these rules, you should aim to fill as many rooms as possible 
in every timeslot while keeping unused slots to a minimum—yet stop short of 
squeezing in extra sessions that would break any of the constraints. In other
words, maximize room utilization without ever overstepping the scheduling logic
you’ve been given.
