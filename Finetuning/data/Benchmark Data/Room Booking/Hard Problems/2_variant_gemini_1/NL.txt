### Logistics Directive: Academic Conference Scheduling

**Project Overview**
You are coordinating the itinerary for a three-day academic conference consisting of exactly twelve sessions. The curriculum is divided into four distinct fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Physics, Mathematics, and Linguistics. The venue provides four separate halls for these presentations.

**Temporal and Spatial Structure**
*   **Daily Schedule:** Each day is divided into three blocks: Morning, Midday, and Evening.
*   **Room Capacity:** A single hall cannot host more than two presentations in a single day.
*   **Buffer Rule:** Consecutive sessions in the same hall are prohibited; if a hall is used twice in one day, an empty block must serve as a buffer between those sessions.
*   **Hall-Specific Restrictions:** 
    *   Hall 2 is unavailable during all Evening blocks.
    *   Hall 4 is strictly prohibited from hosting any AI or Physics presentations.

**Disciplinary Constraints**
*   **AI:** These sessions are restricted exclusively to Morning blocks.
*   **Physics:** These sessions may only be scheduled on Day 1 or Day 2; they are barred from the final day.
*   **Mathematics:** These sessions must be held in either Hall 1 or Hall 3.
*   **Linguistics:** To ensure maximum attendance, no two Linguistics sessions may occur simultaneously.

**Operational Mandates**
*   **Categorical Isolation:** To maintain thematic focus, each hall is restricted to a single discipline per day. You may not mix different subjects in the same room on the same day.
*   **Daily Diversity:** Every day of the conference must include at least one session from each of the four disciplines.
*   **Fixed Milestones:** 
    *   The conference must open (Day 1, Morning) with an AI session.
    *   The conference must conclude (Day 3, Evening) with a Linguistics session.

**Optimization Goal**
Your objective is to populate the schedule with the twelve required sessions while maximizing the use of available halls across all time blocks. You must minimize vacant slots without violating any of the physical or logical boundaries established above. Construct the most densely packed schedule possible that adheres to all parameters.
