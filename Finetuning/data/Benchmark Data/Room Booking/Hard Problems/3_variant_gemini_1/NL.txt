A logistical framework is required to coordinate a four-day symposium featuring ten distinct lectures. These presentations are categorized into four specialized tracks: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Cloud Computing (CC)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Virtual Reality (VR)**. 

The itinerary consists of four daily cycles, each divided into four specific time blocks: Early Morning, Late Morning, Early Afternoon, and Late Afternoon. To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.

### Foundational Protocols
1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.
2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.
3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.
4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.

### Spatial and Technical Restrictions
*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.
*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.

### Categorical and Concurrent Rules
*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.
*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.
*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.

### Fixed Itinerary Anchors
*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.
*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.

### Operational Diversity and Efficiency
*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.
*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums. At least two different topics must be represented in any slot where lectures are occurring.
*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** When determining the ideal layout among multiple valid configurations:
    1.  First, prioritize the schedule that utilizes the highest number of auditoriums simultaneously during each session.
    2.  Second, prioritize the arrangement that results in the fewest total empty auditorium-time slots throughout the four-day event, provided it complies with the non-consecutive usage rule.
