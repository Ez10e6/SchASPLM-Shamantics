You’ve been given the task of organizing ten presentations spanning four specialized
domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things,
and Virtual Reality. The event unfolds over four days, and each day is
structured into four distinct sessions: early morning, late morning, early
afternoon, and late afternoon. A total of five rooms are available throughout
the event.
Each of the ten presentations must be scheduled — no omissions — and
only one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host
no more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,
meaning you can’t assign it to back-to-back sessions.
The schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.
There are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks
a projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one — namely, AI and Cloud
presentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless
of the time or day.
Topical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT
presentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they
can’t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids
AI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day — those topics
must not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.
You’ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely
related topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not
excessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the
same time slot, regardless of room.
A few time-critical constraints must be obeyed. The first scheduled session on Day 1,
occurring in the early morning, must be an AI presentation — no other topic is
permitted to occupy that slot. At the other end of the schedule, the early afternoon
session on Day 4 must be reserved exclusively for VR; no other topic may take that
position.
To ensure consistent coverage and audience engagement, each day must include at least
one presentation, even if others remain unassigned. And each time slot, across all
rooms, should exhibit at least two different topics — no slot should be monopolized
by a single subject area.
Finally, when multiple valid schedules satisfy all the constraints, preference should
be given to those that maximize the number of rooms in use during each session.
Once that’s achieved, the next priority is to minimize idle room-time slots overall,
without violating any rule that would otherwise disqualify a more efficient layout.
