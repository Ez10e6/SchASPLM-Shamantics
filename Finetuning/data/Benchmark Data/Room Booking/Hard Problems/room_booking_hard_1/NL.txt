You’re tasked with planning an intensive two‑day research symposium featuring
ten seminars, each devoted to one of four fields—Artificial Intelligence,
Biology, Mathematics, or Chemistry. Both days are sliced into four
segments — morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon — and
you have five distinct rooms at your disposal.
Naturally, every seminar must find its place in the programme, and no room ever
hosts more than one talk at once. To keep the flow manageable and give each
room a little breathing room, no room may be booked for more than half of the 
time slots in a single day, nor may it run back‑to‑back sessions without a break.
Also, bear in mind that Room 3 goes offline once afternoon begins,
and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment, so any seminar requiring slides
won’t fit there.
Speaking of equipment, both AI and Mathematics talks rely on a working projector,
and the AI presentations have an early‑day preference: they’re confined to the
morning or late‑morning slots. Biology seminars, by contrast, must be sprinkled
across the two days — never exclusively in one — and you cannot have two bio talks
taking place simultaneously. Chemistry talks, on the other hand, are social
in time but solitary in space: no two of them may ever occupy the same
room. Additionally, you can’t mix a Bio session with a Chem
session under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.
There’s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close
with mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both
mathematics events. Beyond that, you’ll want to avoid empty slots
unless there’s simply no alternative. Each time segment should showcase as
many different topics as possible, and while it’s fine for Biology and Chemistry
to overlap with other sessions, no more than two Bio‑or‑Chem seminars may ever
run at the same moment.
With these guidelines in mind, you’ll blend room capacities, projector access, 
temporal preferences, and topic distributions into a single, seamless schedule 
that serves presenters, attendees, and the venues’ technical quirks without leaving
unnecessary gaps.
