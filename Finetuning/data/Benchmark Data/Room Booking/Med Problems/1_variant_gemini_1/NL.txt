Imagine you are the coordinator for a two-day symposium consisting of ten distinct workshops. Each workshop falls into one of three academic categories: Mathematics, Biology, or Artificial Intelligence. The daily schedule is partitioned into three blocks—Morning, Midday, and Afternoon—distributed across four separate halls.

The following parameters must be strictly followed for the spatial and temporal assignment of these workshops:

*   **Capacity and Attendance:** Every workshop requires a unique assignment, and no hall may host multiple sessions simultaneously.
*   **AI Scheduling:** Artificial Intelligence workshops are restricted to the Morning and Midday blocks; they are prohibited from the Afternoon period.
*   **Biological Diversity:** To ensure variety in location, Biology workshops cannot be concentrated in a single hall; at least two different rooms must be utilized for this category.
*   **Facility Maintenance:** Hall 4 is inaccessible during the Midday block on both days.
*   **Mathematical Sequencing:** Mathematics workshops must be scheduled such that no two occur at the same time, regardless of the hall assigned.
*   **Session 5 Specifics:** Workshop 5 is mandated for Day 2. It is restricted from the Morning block (meaning it must occur during the Midday or Afternoon).
*   **Sessions 6 & 7 Pairing:** Workshop 6 and Workshop 7 must be assigned to the exact same hall, but their dates must differ (one on Day 1 and the other on Day 2).
