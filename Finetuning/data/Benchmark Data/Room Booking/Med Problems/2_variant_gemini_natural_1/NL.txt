We’re currently in the process of coordinating a series of eight graduate workshops scheduled over the course of two days. Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.

There are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.

The subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.

To ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible. While we must strictly adhere to all these rules, we want to minimize the number of unused room-time slots across the two-day period.
