You’re organizing a two-day event featuring a total of ten seminars, each
focused on a topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology, or
Mathematics. Each day is divided into three time slots — morning,
midday, and afternoon — and there are four available rooms in which
the seminars can be held.
Every seminar needs a spot on the schedule, and no room can host more
than one seminar during any given time slot.
There are several constraints tied to the seminar topics and venue
logistics. To start with, seminars on AI should only be scheduled
in the morning or midday — these talks aren't suitable for the
afternoon. For Biology, you’ll need to make sure that its seminars
are spread out — they can't all take place in the same room; at
least two different rooms must be used for them.
Also note that Room 4 is off-limits at midday, regardless of the day
 — that slot is unavailable for use in that room entirely.
As for the Math seminars, you’ll need to ensure that no two of them
are happening at the same time, even if they’re in different rooms.
There are also a few seminar-specific instructions: Seminar 5 must be
scheduled on the second day, but it can't be placed in the morning
slot. Additionally, Seminar 6 and Seminar 7 should be assigned to
the same room, but not on the same day — they need to be spaced 
out across the two days.
