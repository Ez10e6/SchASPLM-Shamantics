### System Specification: Graduate Workshop Scheduling

**Document Purpose:** Formal architectural requirements for the allocation of eight (8) graduate workshops across a two-day schedule.

---

#### 1. Domain Definitions
*   **Workshops ($W$):** A set of 8 distinct sessions $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_8\}$.
*   **Topics ($S$):** Each workshop is categorized as exactly one of: {Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mathematics (Math), Biology (Bio)}.
*   **Time Slots ($T$):** {Morning, Midday, Afternoon}.
*   **Days ($D$):** {Day 1, Day 2}.
*   **Rooms ($R$):** {Room 1, Room 2, Room 3}.
*   **Schedule Slot:** A unique combination of $(d \in D, t \in T, r \in R)$. Total available slots: 18.

---

#### 2. Functional Requirements
*   **R2.1 (Allocation):** Every workshop $w \in W$ must be assigned to exactly one Schedule Slot.
*   **R2.2 (Uniqueness):** No more than one workshop may be assigned to any specific Schedule Slot $(d, t, r)$.

#### 3. Operational Constraints

**3.1 Room & Temporal Constraints**
*   **C3.1.1 (Room Capacity):** For any day $d$ and room $r$, the total number of assigned workshops must not exceed two (2).
*   **C3.1.2 (Mandatory Vacancy):** Every room must contain at least one (1) unused time slot per day.
*   **C3.1.3 (Room 2 Restriction):** No workshop shall be scheduled in Room 2 during the Afternoon slot on Day 1 or Day 2.

**3.2 Topic-Specific Constraints**
*   **C3.2.1 (AI Timing):** Workshops categorized as AI must be scheduled exclusively in the Morning slot.
*   **C3.2.2 (Math Concurrency):** No two Math workshops may occur during the same time slot $t$ on the same day $d$, regardless of room assignment.
*   **C3.2.3 (AI/Bio Spatial Exclusion):** If an AI workshop is assigned to room $r$ on day $d$, no Biology workshop may be assigned to that same room $r$ on that same day $d$.

**3.3 Daily Subject Coverage**
*   **C3.3.1 (Diversity Requirement):** Each day $d \in \{1, 2\}$ must include at least one (1) AI workshop, at least one (1) Math workshop, and at least one (1) Biology workshop.

---

#### 4. Optimization Objective
*   **O4.1 (Space Efficiency):** Maximize the utilization of available room-time slots.
*   **O4.2 (Idle Minimization):** Minimize the number of unused valid Schedule Slots while strictly adhering to all constraints in Section 3. (Note: Given the fixed count of 8 workshops and the constraint of max 2 per room/day, efficiency is defined by validly placing all 8 workshops within the restricted 12-slot capacity).

#### 5. Constraint Summary Table

| Topic | Time Constraint | Room/Conflict Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI** | Morning Only | No Biology workshops in the same room/day. |
| **Math** | No simultaneous sessions | None. |
| **Bio** | No Morning/Midday/Afternoon restriction | No AI workshops in the same room/day. |
| **General** | Room 2 Afternoon = Closed | Max 2 workshops per room per day. |
