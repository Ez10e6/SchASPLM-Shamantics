You’re coordinating a series of eight graduate workshops across two days.
Each workshop focuses on one of three subjects: Artificial Intelligence
(AI), Mathematics, or Biology. The event spans two full days, and each
day is divided into three time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon.
You have access to three rooms where these workshops can be held.
Every workshop must be placed somewhere in the schedule — that is,
assigned to at least one session at a specific room and a specific time on
one of the two days.
No two workshops can occupy the same room at the same time, and each
room is limited to a maximum of two workshops per day. So, on any
given day, each room will have at least one unused time slot.
However, one of the rooms comes with a constraint: Room 2 is unavailable
in the afternoon, on both days. You’ll need to avoid scheduling anything
there during that time.
Topic-specific requirements further shape the schedule. AI workshops must
always be held in the morning, so they cannot be scheduled at midday or
in the afternoon. Math workshops must not overlap with each other in
time, meaning that no two math sessions can occur simultaneously
 — even if they’re in different rooms. In addition, AI and Biology
workshops must not share a room on the same day. If an AI session
takes place in a given room on a given day, then no Biology session
can be placed in that room on that day, and vice versa.
Finally, to ensure balanced subject coverage, each day must include at
least one workshop from each topic — AI, Math, and Bio — so no subject
is omitted from a day’s agenda.
When choosing among valid schedules, it’s preferable to use space
efficiently: try to fill as many available slots as possible while
respecting all the constraints. The fewer unused room-times, the better.
