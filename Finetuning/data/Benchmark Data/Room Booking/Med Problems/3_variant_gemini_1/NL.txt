Your objective is to coordinate a single-day itinerary for six educational modules. These modules are categorized into three distinct tracks: **Data Analytics**, **System Operations**, and **User Experience (UX)**. The schedule is partitioned into three chronological blocks—**Morning**, **Noon**, and **Afternoon**—with three separate **Venues** available for use.

The following logistical parameters and topical constraints must be strictly observed:

**Logistical Constraints:**
*   **Total Volume:** All six modules must be assigned to a specific block and a specific venue.
*   **Venue Capacity:** To prevent over-utilization, no venue may host more than two modules throughout the day.
*   **Single Occupancy:** Only one module can occupy a specific venue during any single time block.
*   **Efficiency:** The final configuration should maximize the utility of the nine available venue-block pairings by ensuring all six modules are successfully placed without violating the room-load limit.

**Track-Specific Rules:**
*   **System Operations:** Modules in this track are restricted exclusively to the **Noon** block; they cannot be scheduled at any other time.
*   **Data Analytics:** These modules are strictly prohibited from using **Venue 3**, regardless of the time block.
*   **Concurrent Prohibition:** To prevent resource conflicts, **UX** and **Data Analytics** modules are forbidden from running simultaneously. You must ensure these two tracks never appear in different venues during the same time block.
*   **Curriculum Balance:** The final schedule must be representative of the entire program; at least one module from each of the three tracks (Data, Operations, and UX) must be included in the six-module total.
