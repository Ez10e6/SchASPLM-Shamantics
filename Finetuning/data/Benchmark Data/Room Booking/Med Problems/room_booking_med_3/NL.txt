You’ve been asked to organize six workshops taking place over a single
day. Each workshop focuses on one of three topics: Data, DevOps, or
User Interface (UI). The day is structured into three time slots
 — morning, midday, and afternoon — and the venue provides three rooms
in which the sessions can be held.
Every workshop must be scheduled at least once, with a clear assignment to
both a time slot and a room. The scheduling is subject to a few
logistical limits: each room can be used for no more than two sessions
over the course of the day, and, naturally, no two workshops can occupy the
same room at the same time.
There are also topic-specific restrictions that must be followed. 
DevOps workshops can only be held during the midday session — no 
exceptions. Any workshops on Data must avoid Room 3 entirely, 
regardless of time. In addition, UI and Data workshops are not allowed
to run concurrently; you’ll need to ensure that those two topics don’t
appear in different rooms during the same time slot.
To ensure the day’s agenda is well-rounded, at least one workshop from
each topic area must appear somewhere on the schedule.
Lastly, while satisfying all of the above constraints, you should also
aim to minimize unused room-time slots. The goal is to make efficient
use of the available space without overstepping any of the scheduling
rules.
