You are organizing a series of six seminars, and each one must be scheduled to take
place in a specific room at a specific time. There are three time slots available
throughout the day: morning, midday, and afternoon. The venue also offers three
rooms where the seminars can be held.
Each seminar needs to be held, and no two seminars are allowed to happen in
the same room at the same time — that would cause a scheduling conflict.
However, there's a restriction on Room 3: it cannot be used for any seminar
scheduled in the afternoon.
Additionally, Seminar 1 must be held in Room 1, regardless of when it’s scheduled.
Finally, Seminar 2 and Seminar 3 must not take place during the same time slot,
even if they are in different rooms.
