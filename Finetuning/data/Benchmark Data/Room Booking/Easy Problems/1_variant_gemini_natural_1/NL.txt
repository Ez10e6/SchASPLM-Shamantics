Hey, I’m working on finalizing the schedule for our upcoming event, and I could use your help getting these six seminars organized. We have three time slots available throughout the day—morning, midday, and afternoon—and the venue has provided us with three different rooms to use. The main goal is to make sure every single seminar is assigned a spot, but obviously, we have to be careful not to schedule two different sessions in the same room at the same time, or we’ll have a major conflict on our hands.

There are a few specific quirks we need to work around for this to go smoothly. First off, the venue staff mentioned that Room 3 is undergoing some maintenance or something, so it’s completely off-limits for any seminar scheduled in the afternoon slot. We also have a special requirement for Seminar 1; for logistical reasons, it must be held in Room 1, though it doesn't matter which of the three time slots we choose for it. 

Finally, we have to keep the timing of Seminars 2 and 3 in mind. The speakers for those two sessions need to attend each other's presentations, so those two seminars cannot take place during the same time slot, even if they are held in different rooms. If we can just navigate those few constraints, we should have a solid plan for the day.
