You are responsible for scheduling five lectures, each of which focuses on one of
three subjects: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mathematics, or Physics.
There are two time slots available during the day: morning and afternoon,
and three rooms in which the lectures can be held.
Every lecture must be assigned a room and a time slot
 — no lecture can be skipped or duplicated.
A room can host at most one lecture in each time slot, so you can’t double-book
a room.
There’s one important subject-specific constraint: Math and Physics lectures are
not allowed to take place in the same room, even if they’re scheduled at
different times.
