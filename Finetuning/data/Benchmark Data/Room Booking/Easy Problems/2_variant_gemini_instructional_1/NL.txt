### **System Specification: Lecture Scheduling and Resource Allocation**

#### **1. System Entities and Domains**
Define the following finite sets for the scheduling environment:
*   **Lectures ($L$):** A set of five unique elements $\{l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4, l_5\}$.
*   **Subjects ($S$):** $\{Artificial\ Intelligence\ (AI),\ Mathematics\ (Math),\ Physics\ (Physics)\}$.
*   **Time Slots ($T$):** $\{Morning,\ Afternoon\}$.
*   **Rooms ($R$):** $\{Room_1,\ Room_2,\ Room_3\}$.

#### **2. Allocation Requirements**
Each lecture $l \in L$ is associated with exactly one subject $s \in S$. The system must generate a total assignment mapping $A: L \rightarrow (R \times T)$ such that:
*   Every lecture $l \in L$ is assigned exactly one Room-Time pair.
*   No lecture remains unassigned.
*   No lecture is assigned to multiple Room-Time pairs.

#### **3. Operational Constraints**

**3.1 Resource Capacity (Mutual Exclusion)**
*   Prohibit the assignment of more than one lecture to the same Room-Time coordinate. 
*   Formally: For any two distinct lectures $l_i, l_j \in L$, if $A(l_i) = (r_i, t_i)$ and $A(l_j) = (r_j, t_j)$, then $(r_i, t_i) \neq (r_j, t_j)$.

**3.2 Subject-Room Compatibility**
*   Restrict room usage based on subject classification.
*   Prohibit any room $r \in R$ from hosting both a **Mathematics** lecture and a **Physics** lecture, regardless of the time slot.
*   If a room $r$ is assigned to a lecture where $Subject = Math$, ensure that same room $r$ is never assigned to a lecture where $Subject = Physics$ within the same schedule, and vice versa.

#### **4. Objective Summary**
Ensure the final schedule populates 5 of the 6 available Room-Time slots while maintaining strict adherence to the subject-based room isolation policy between Mathematics and Physics.
