You need to schedule four training sessions, each of which covers either Networking
or Security.
All sessions take place over a single day, and you have two time slots to work with:
morning and afternoon. There are also two available rooms.
Every session must be assigned a specific room and time slot — no session can be
left out.
Each room can host only one session at a time, so you can’t schedule two sessions
in the same room during the same time slot.
There are also topic-based constraints: all Security sessions must be held in the
afternoon, and all Networking sessions must be scheduled somewhere other than
Room 1.
