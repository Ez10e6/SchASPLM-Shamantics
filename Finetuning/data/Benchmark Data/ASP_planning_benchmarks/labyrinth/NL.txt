You are tasked with solving a dynamic Labyrinth puzzle.
The puzzle consists of a grid of fields with specific dimensions (rows and columns).
The input defines the initial location of a starting point (reach) and a goal point.
It also defines connections between fields in specific directions (North, South, East, West).

The objective is to manipulate the grid to create a path from the start point to the goal point.
Manipulation is done by "pushing" entire rows or columns in a specific direction.
Rules:
1. At each time step, you can choose to push either a row or a column.
2. Pushing a row/column shifts all fields in that row/column in the specified direction.
3. The grid wraps around (toroidal), meaning fields pushed off one edge reappear on the opposite edge.
4. Connections between fields move with the fields when they are pushed.
5. Reachability propagates through connected fields.
6. The goal is reached when the goal field is marked as reachable.

The solution must output the sequence of push actions required to reach the goal within a maximum number of steps.
