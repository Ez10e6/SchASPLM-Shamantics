You are tasked with solving the Nomystery transport logistics problem.
The environment consists of locations connected by routes with specific fuel costs.
There are trucks (with limited fuel) and packages at initial locations.
The goal is to transport specific packages to their target destinations.

At each time step, exactly one action can occur:
1. Load a package into a truck (if they are at the same location).
2. Unload a package from a truck (if the truck is at the location).
3. Drive a truck from one location to another (if there is a direct connection and the truck has enough fuel).

Driving consumes fuel equal to the cost of the route.
You cannot load or unload if the preconditions are not met.
The solution must output the sequence of actions that achieves the goal state.
