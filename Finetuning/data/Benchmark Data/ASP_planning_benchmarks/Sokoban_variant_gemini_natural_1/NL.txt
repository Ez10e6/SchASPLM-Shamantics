Imagine you have just stepped into a complex warehouse environment, a grid-like layout where your only objective is to organize a set of heavy stones. You are the designated pusher, starting at a specific position on the floor, and your mission is to navigate this space until every single stone has been moved onto its corresponding goal location. The layout consists of solid walls that block your path, empty floor space where you can move freely, and the stones themselves, which require careful handling.

As you navigate the grid, you can step into any adjacent clear square to the North, South, East, or West. When you find yourself standing next to a stone, you have the ability to push it forward into an adjacent square, but this is only possible if the square directly behind the stone is currently clear. You must plan your route with extreme care because your physical limitations are quite strict; you can only push a stone away from you and are completely unable to pull one back if it gets stuck in a corner. 

Furthermore, you lack the strength to push more than a single stone at any given time, meaning you cannot move a line of two or more stones at once. You are also restricted by the physical boundaries of the room, as you cannot pass through solid walls or walk through a square that is already occupied by a stone. To successfully solve this puzzle, you must determine the exact sequence of directional moves and pushes that will result in a state where every stone is resting perfectly on a designated goal square.
