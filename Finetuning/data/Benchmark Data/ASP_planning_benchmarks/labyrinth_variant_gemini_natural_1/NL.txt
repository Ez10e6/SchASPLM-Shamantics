Imagine you are standing before a complex, dynamic Labyrinth designed as a grid of fields, organized into a specific number of rows and columns. At the start of this challenge, you are assigned a fixed starting point, which we consider the initial "reachable" zone, and a distant goal point that you need to access. Each individual field within the grid is unique because it contains specific directional connections—think of them as fixed corridors—pointing North, South, East, or West, which dictate how you can move from one field to its neighbor.

The core of the puzzle involves physically manipulating the layout of the Labyrinth to bridge the gap between your starting position and the target. At every time step, you are permitted to make a single move by "pushing" either an entire row or an entire column in a specific direction. This action shifts every field within that row or column simultaneously. Because the grid is toroidal, it behaves like a wrap-around map; any field that is pushed off the edge of the grid doesn't disappear but instead reappears on the opposite side of that same row or column.

Crucially, the directional connections are intrinsic to the fields themselves, meaning that as you shift the rows and columns, the North, South, East, and West corridors move right along with the fields they belong to. Your objective is to use these shifts to align the corridors so that a continuous path of connectivity is formed. Reachability propagates through these connected fields instantaneously; the moment a valid path of connections exists between your starting point and the goal, the goal is marked as reachable and the puzzle is solved. To succeed, you must determine the precise sequence of row and column pushes required to make the goal reachable, ensuring the entire operation is completed within a designated maximum number of steps.
