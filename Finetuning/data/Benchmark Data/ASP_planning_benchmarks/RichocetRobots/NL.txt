You are tasked with solving the Ricochet Robots puzzle.
The board is a grid with specified dimensions (rows and columns).
The input defines the initial positions of several robots and the locations of barriers (walls).
The goal is to move specific robots to specific target locations.

The movement rules are unique:
1. At each step, you select exactly one robot to move.
2. You select exactly one direction (North, South, East, West).
3. Once a robot starts moving, it slides continuously in the chosen direction until it is blocked.
4. A robot is blocked if it hits a barrier or another robot.
5. The robot stops at the last valid square before the obstacle.
6. A robot cannot stop mid-path; it must slide fully.

The solution must output the sequence of moves (robot, direction, time) to achieve the target configuration within a maximum number of steps.
