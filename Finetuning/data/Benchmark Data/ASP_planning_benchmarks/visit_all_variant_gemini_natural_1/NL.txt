Imagine we are managing a logistics robot stationed within a facility composed of various interconnected locations. These locations are treated as nodes in a network, linked together by specific pathways or edges that define where the robot can travel. Your primary objective is to orchestrate a journey for this robot that begins at a designated starting point and successfully reaches a specific set of target locations scattered across the map.

The movement of the robot is governed by a strict set of operational rules. It must begin its journey at the precise initial position provided in the mission parameters. From there, the robot progresses through the environment one step at a time. During every individual time step, the robot must move from its current location to exactly one adjacent node that is directly connected by an edge. It cannot remain stationary or skip between non-connected points; every move must be a single, deliberate transition to a neighboring spot.

The mission is only considered successful if the robot manages to visit every single location marked as a target at least once. It doesn't matter if the robot passes through these targets multiple times or navigates through non-essential locations to reach them, provided that by the end of the journey, no target remains unvisited. Crucially, this entire operation must be completed within a strictly defined number of time steps. If the robot cannot reach all its targets before this time limit expires, the plan is invalid. To solve this problem, you must provide the complete, chronological sequence of moves the robot takes, detailing its path from the starting node until the mission is accomplished within the allotted timeframe.
