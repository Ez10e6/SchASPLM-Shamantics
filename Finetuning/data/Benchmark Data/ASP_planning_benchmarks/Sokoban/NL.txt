You are tasked with solving the Sokoban puzzle.
The environment is a grid where some cells contain stones, some are empty (clear), and some are walls.
There is a player (pusher) at a specific starting location.
The goal is to push all stones onto designated goal locations.

The rules are:
1. The player can move to an adjacent clear square (North, South, East, West).
2. The player can push a stone to an adjacent square if the square behind the stone is clear.
3. You cannot pull stones.
4. You cannot push two stones at once.
5. You cannot move through walls or stones.

The solution must output the sequence of actions (move or push) to reach the goal state where all stones are on goal squares.
