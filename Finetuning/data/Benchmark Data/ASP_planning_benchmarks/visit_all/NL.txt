You are tasked with solving the Visit All problem.
The environment consists of a set of locations (nodes) connected by edges.
The input specifies the starting location of a robot and a set of target locations that must be visited.

The objective is to find a path for the robot such that:
1. The robot starts at the given initial position.
2. At each time step, the robot moves to exactly one connected adjacent location.
3. The robot must visit every location marked as a target at least once during the path.
4. The path must be completed within the defined number of time steps.

The solution should output the sequence of moves.
