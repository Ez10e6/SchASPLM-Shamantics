You are tasked with solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
The input consists of 'k' disks, where disks 1 to 4 represent fixed pegs and disks 5 to k are movable.
Larger disk numbers correspond to smaller physical disks.
The initial state specifies which disk is on top of which.
The goal state specifies the desired final configuration.

The objective is to move the disks from the initial configuration to the goal configuration in a specified number of time steps.
Rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be moved if it is the top disk on its stack.
3. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk (or a peg).
4. No disk can be moved in two consecutive time steps.
5. Pegs cannot be moved.

The solution must output the sequence of moves.
