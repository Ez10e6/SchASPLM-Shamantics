Imagine you’re standing in front of a specialized mechanical assembly station designed to solve a complex variation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. In this setup, we are working with a total of $k$ components. It is important to note that the first four components, numbered 1 through 4, are actually fixed pegs bolted to the workbench; they serve as the foundations for our stacks and cannot be moved under any circumstances. The remaining components, numbered from 5 up to $k$, are the movable disks we’ll be manipulating.

The sizing of these disks follows a specific, somewhat counter-intuitive logic: as the identification number of a disk increases, its physical size actually decreases. This means that disk 5 is the largest movable piece in the set, while disk $k$ is the smallest. To maintain a stable stack, you must follow the fundamental rule of placement: a disk can only be set down if it is being placed on top of a physically larger object. In our numbering system, this means a disk can only land on a disk or a peg that has a lower numerical value than its own.

We are starting with the disks arranged in a specific initial configuration, where the layout describes exactly which disk is resting on which. Our objective is to transition the entire set into a target goal configuration within a strictly defined number of time steps. 

As you plan the sequence of moves, there are a few operational constraints to keep in mind. We are only permitted to move a single disk during any given time step, and you can only pick up a disk if it is currently at the very top of its stack with nothing resting above it. Furthermore, there is a strict "cool-down" rule in effect: once you move a specific disk, you are prohibited from moving that same disk again in the very next time step. You’ll need to alternate your focus to a different piece before you can return to the previous one. Your final task is to document the exact sequence of moves required to reach the goal state while adhering to all these requirements.
