You are configuring a drone for a delivery service. You must choose a frame, motor
type, and battery.
The drone’s flight endurance is the primary metric, and you want to maximize it while
ensuring that power and weight constraints are satisfied.
Available options:
    Frames: Lightweight, Standard, Reinforced
    Motors: Eco, Standard, HighTorque
    Batteries: SmallCell, MediumCell, LongLife
Constraints:
    Lightweight frames can’t handle HighTorque motors.
    Reinforced frames are required for LongLife batteries.
    HighTorque motors draw more power and require LongLife batteries.
    SmallCell batteries can only power Eco motors.
    MediumCell batteries are compatible with Eco or Standard motors.
Endurance scores:
    Lightweight: 50, Standard: 40, Reinforced: 30
    Eco: 60, Standard: 70, HighTorque: 90
    SmallCell: 30, MediumCell: 50, LongLife: 80
