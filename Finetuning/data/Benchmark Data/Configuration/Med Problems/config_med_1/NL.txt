You’re assembling a workstation for AI research. You need to pick compatible components:
a processor, a graphics card, a motherboard, and a power supply unit (PSU).
Your choices must balance performance and cost, but your primary goal is to
minimize the overall hardware cost.
The component options are as follows:
    Processors: Ryzen7, i9, and Xeon. Ryzen7 is best paired with mainstream boards,
    while Xeon is strictly a server-grade option.
    Graphics cards: RTX4060, RTX3090, and Quadro. Both the Quadro and RTX3090 consume
    significant power.
    Motherboards: X670, Z690, and C621. The C621 is a workstation-class board.
    Power supplies: Bronze, Gold, and Platinum, reflecting increasing levels of 
    efficiency and capacity.
Keep these compatibility rules in mind:
    Power-hungry GPUs (RTX3090, Quadro) can’t operate with a Bronze PSU.
    Xeon must be installed in a C621 motherboard.
    Ryzen7 works only with the X670 board.
    The i9 cannot be paired with the X670.
    Quadro requires a Xeon CPU.
    Quadro is not compatable with the Z690 motherboard.
The final build must meet all constraints and minimize cost. Component costs are:
    Ryzen7: 300, i9: 400, Xeon: 500
    RTX4060: 350, RTX3090: 700, Quadro: 800
    X670: 180, Z690: 200, C621: 250
    Bronze PSU: 80, Gold: 120, Platinum: 160
