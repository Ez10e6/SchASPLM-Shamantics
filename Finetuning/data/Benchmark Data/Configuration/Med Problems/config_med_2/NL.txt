You're customizing a gaming laptop by selecting a CPU, GPU, and a cooling system.
Each component has a performance rating, and your goal is to maximize performance
without violating thermal constraints.
You can pick from:
CPUs: Ryzen9, i7, or M1.
GPUs: RTX3070, RX6700XT, and IrisXe.
Cooling systems: AirCool, LiquidCool, and PassiveCool.

Performance matters — the faster the CPU and GPU, the better. But cooling must be
sufficient:
LiquidCool is required for high-performance parts like Ryzen9 or RTX3070.
PassiveCool is insufficient for discrete GPUs.
M1 chips are low-heat and can use PassiveCool.
RX6700XT is incompatible with M1.

Performance scores:
Ryzen9: 95, i7: 85, M1: 70
RTX3070: 90, RX6700XT: 88, IrisXe: 65
AirCool: 20, LiquidCool: 40, PassiveCool: 5
