You are tasked with the procurement of a new deep-learning terminal. Your objective is to select four essential components—a CPU, a GPU, a mainboard, and a power delivery unit—while maintaining the absolute lowest total expenditure.

The available inventory and associated unit prices are as follows:

**Central Computing Units (CPUs):**
*   Ryzen7: $300
*   i9: $400
*   Xeon: $500

**Graphics Accelerators (GPUs):**
*   RTX4060: $350
*   RTX3090: $700
*   Quadro: $800

**System Mainboards:**
*   X670: $180
*   Z690: $200
*   C621: $250

**Power Supply Units (PSUs):**
*   Bronze: $80
*   Gold: $120
*   Platinum: $160

To ensure system stability, your configuration must adhere to these rigid technical specifications:
1.  **Energy Demands:** High-draw graphics cards (specifically the RTX3090 and the Quadro) are strictly prohibited from being paired with a Bronze-tier power supply.
2.  **Xeon Integration:** If a Xeon processor is selected, it must be seated in a C621 mainboard.
3.  **Ryzen7 Architecture:** The Ryzen7 chip is exclusive to the X670 platform.
4.  **Intel Compatibility:** The i9 processor is physically incompatible with the X670 mainboard.
5.  **Professional Graphics:** Deploying a Quadro GPU necessitates the use of a Xeon CPU.
6.  **Quadro Limitations:** The Quadro card cannot be installed on a Z690 mainboard.

Identify the combination of hardware that satisfies every operational requirement at the minimum possible price point.
