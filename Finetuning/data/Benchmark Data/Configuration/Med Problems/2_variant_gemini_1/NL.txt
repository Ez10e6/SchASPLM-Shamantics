An engineer is configuring a high-end workstation by selecting one processor (CPU), one graphics card (GPU), and a corresponding thermal management solution. The objective is to maximize the combined efficiency rating of the assembly while strictly adhering to hardware compatibility and heat dissipation protocols.

**Available Components and Efficiency Ratings:**

*   **Processors:** Ryzen9 (95), i7 (85), and M1 (70).
*   **Graphics Cards:** RTX3070 (90), RX6700XT (88), and IrisXe (65).
*   **Thermal Management:** LiquidCool (40), AirCool (20), and PassiveCool (5).

**System Integration Constraints:**

1.  **High-Thermal Demand:** The installation of either a Ryzen9 CPU or an RTX3070 GPU mandates the use of the LiquidCool system.
2.  **Discrete GPU Limits:** PassiveCooling is insufficient for discrete graphics hardware; therefore, it cannot be paired with the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT.
3.  **Low-Power Exception:** The M1 processor is the only chipset thermally efficient enough to be compatible with a PassiveCool setup.
4.  **Architecture Conflict:** The RX6700XT graphics card cannot be interfaced with the M1 processor due to a driver mismatch.
