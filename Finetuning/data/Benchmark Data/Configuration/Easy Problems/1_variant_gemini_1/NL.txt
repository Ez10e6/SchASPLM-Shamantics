To configure a functional computer system, you must select a single unit from each of the following three hardware categories:

*   **Processors:** Ryzen5 or i5
*   **Graphics Cards:** GTX1660 or RX580
*   **Mainboards:** B450 or Z390

Your finalized hardware trio must strictly adhere to these interoperability requirements:

1.  The Ryzen5 processor is restricted to operation with the B450 mainboard.
2.  The i5 processor functions exclusively on the Z390 mainboard.
3.  The RX580 graphics card is incompatible with the Z390 mainboard.

Identify a combination of one processor, one graphics card, and one mainboard that satisfies all technical constraints.
