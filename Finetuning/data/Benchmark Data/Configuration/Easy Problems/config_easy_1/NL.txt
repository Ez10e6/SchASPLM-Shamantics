You are assembling a basic custom PC build using three components: a CPU, a GPU, and a motherboard.
There are two options for each component type:
CPUs: Ryzen5 or i5
GPUs: GTX1660 or RX580
Motherboards: B450 or Z390
Each final build must include exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one motherboard.
However, there are compatibility rules:
The Ryzen5 CPU is only compatible with the B450 motherboard.
The i5 CPU is only compatible with the Z390 motherboard.
The RX580 GPU is not compatible with the Z390 motherboard.
You must select a valid combination of components that satisfies all compatibility constraints.
