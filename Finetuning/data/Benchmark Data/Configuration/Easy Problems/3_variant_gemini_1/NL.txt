Configure a bespoke mobile subscription by selecting exactly one item from each of the three following categories:

*   **Connectivity Tiers:** LiteLink, UltraNet
*   **Hardware:** Phono-1, Phono-2
*   **Protective Gear:** Shield-Pro, Skin-Lite

Your selection must adhere to these technical limitations:
1.  LiteLink connectivity is unsupported on the Phono-2 hardware.
2.  Any Phono-1 hardware configuration mandates the use of Shield-Pro protective gear.
3.  UltraNet connectivity cannot be bundled with Shield-Pro protective gear.

Identify a viable trio that satisfies every rule mentioned above.
