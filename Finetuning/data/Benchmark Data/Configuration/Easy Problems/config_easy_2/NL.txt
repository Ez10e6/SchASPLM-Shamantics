You are configuring a simple home audio setup. The system requires one speaker,
one amplifier, and one media player.
The available components are:
Speakers: Alpha, Beta
Amplifiers: AmpX, AmpY
Media Players: Streamer1, Streamer2
However, some compatibility constraints apply:
Speaker Alpha is only compatible with AmpX.
AmpY is incompatible with Streamer1.
Streamer2 can only be used with Speaker Beta.
Select one component of each type to form a valid, compatible configuration.
