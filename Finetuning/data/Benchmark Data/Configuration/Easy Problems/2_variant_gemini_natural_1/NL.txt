Hey, I’m putting together that home audio setup we talked about, but I’ve run into a few compatibility headaches with the gear we have on hand. We have two speakers to choose from, the Alpha and the Beta, along with two different amplifiers, AmpX and AmpY, and two media players, Streamer1 and Streamer2. The catch is that we have to be very careful about how we pair them up to ensure the system actually works. 

For instance, the Alpha speaker is a bit finicky and will only work if we use AmpX to power it. On the digital side, we have to remember that AmpY and Streamer1 are completely incompatible with each other, so those two can never be used in the same configuration. To make matters even more complicated, the Streamer2 is designed with a very specific output that only functions when it's paired with the Beta speaker. We just need to select exactly one speaker, one amplifier, and one media player that respect all these quirks so we can finally get the music playing.
