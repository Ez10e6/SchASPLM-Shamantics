Your objective is to assemble a functional three-piece entertainment rig. A complete set must include exactly one acoustic driver, one power stage, and one source unit.

The warehouse stocks the following hardware:
*   **Acoustic Drivers:** Alpha, Beta
*   **Power Stages:** AmpX, AmpY
*   **Source Units:** Streamer1, Streamer2

To ensure the system operates correctly, you must adhere to these technical specifications:
1.  The Alpha driver is exclusively operational when paired with the AmpX power stage.
2.  Technical interference prevents the AmpY power stage from functioning alongside the Streamer1 source unit.
3.  Selecting Streamer2 as your source unit mandates the use of the Beta acoustic driver.

Propose a single three-component assembly that satisfies all listed operational requirements.
