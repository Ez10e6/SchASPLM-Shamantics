CPUs = {FalconX, CoreZen, EcoMini};
Costs: [600, 500, 300]; Performance: [125, 115, 90].
GPUs = {TitanZ, MidlineGT, Pixie};
Costs: [700, 500, 400]; Performance: [135, 100, 95].
Drives = {FlashNova, Terabox, BudgetDisk};
Costs: [250, 300, 150]; Performance: [110, 100, 60].
Select one CPU, one GPU, one drive.
Mid-performance component must be the cheapest.
If CPU > $500 can not use Pixie GPU.
Max - min performance ≤ 50.
If drive is FlashNova, GPU performance ≥ 100.
Exactly two selected components must cost > $300.
GPU performance must be between CPU and drive.
