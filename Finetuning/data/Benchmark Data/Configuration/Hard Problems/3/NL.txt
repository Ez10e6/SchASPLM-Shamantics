Procurement has turned philosophical: “Don’t always buy the most powerful; buy the right
powerful.” You’re assembling a balanced data-processing workstation, and the specs you must
navigate are less about raw numbers and more about proportionality.
CPUs — FalconX ($600, 125 pts), CoreZen ($500, 115 pts), EcoMini ($300, 90 pts)
GPUs — TitanZ ($700, 135 pts), MidlineGT ($500, 100 pts), Pixie ($400, 95 pts)
Drives — FlashNova ($250, 110 pts), Terabox ($300, 100 pts), BudgetDisk ($150, 60 pts)
Each component must be selected from its category. But the trick is in how these relate.
The component with the middle performance value (not highest or lowest) must be the cheapest
among the three selected parts.
If you pick a CPU worth more than $500, you can’t pair it with the Pixie GPU.
Avoid configurations where the performance spread (max - min) exceeds 50 points.
If you select the FlashNova SSD, the GPU must score at least 100.
You must select exactly two components whose price is above $300 and the GPU’s performance
must fall between the CPU and drive—i.e., not the highest or lowest.
