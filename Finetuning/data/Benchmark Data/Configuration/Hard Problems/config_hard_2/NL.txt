The media lab is assembling a suite of machines for real-time 3D rendering, and while performance
is paramount, the budget committee is breathing down everyone’s neck about excess spending.
You’re tasked with selecting exactly one component from each of three categories: CPUs, GPUs,
and power supplies. Each component is annotated with its wattage and price tag, and while you
can technically pick anything, there are tight constraints.
Here’s what’s on the list:
CPUs — BoltX (wattage: 85W, $400), HydraPro (125W, $550), LiteCore (60W, $350)
GPUs — StormZ (180W, $800), Nebula9 (150W, $650), VegaLite (95W, $500)
Power Supplies — PowerMax750 (capacity: 750W, $200), Eco600 (600W, $150), Titan900 (900W, $250)
You’ll need to ensure that the total system draw—i.e., the sum of selected CPU and GPU
wattages—remains at least 100W below the selected power supply’s maximum output.
Apparently, this is to avoid overloading under peak load bursts.
There’s another thing: the most power-hungry part (by wattage) in your final configuration
must also be the most expensive. That rule is apparently about cost justification.
Compatibility is a minefield: HydraPro doesn’t play nicely with VegaLite due to thermal
constraints, and if you pick Eco600, you can’t use StormZ, which requires better voltage
regulation. Oh, and you’re not allowed to pick all three cheapest components. Also, no pair of 
selected parts can differ in cost by more than $400.
