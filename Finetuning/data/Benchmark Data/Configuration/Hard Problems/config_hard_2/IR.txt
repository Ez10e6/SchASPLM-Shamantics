Select one CPU, one GPU, one PSU.
Total CPU+GPU draw ≤ PSU capacity - 100.
Most power-hungry selected component must also be the most expensive.
Incompatible pairs: (HydraPro, VegaLite), (Eco600, StormZ).
Do not select all three cheapest components.
No two selected components can differ in cost by more than $400.
