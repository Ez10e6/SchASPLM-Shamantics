A high-end visualization facility is procuring hardware for a new 3D rendering cluster. While raw processing power is a priority, the procurement office has mandated strict fiscal oversight. You must configure a single workstation by selecting exactly one component from three specific categories: Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Power Supply Units (PSUs).

The available inventory is as follows:

**Processors (CPUs):**
*   **BoltX:** 85W power draw | $400
*   **HydraPro:** 125W power draw | $550
*   **LiteCore:** 60W power draw | $350

**Graphics Cards (GPUs):**
*   **StormZ:** 180W power draw | $800
*   **Nebula9:** 150W power draw | $650
*   **VegaLite:** 95W power draw | $500

**Power Units (PSUs):**
*   **PowerMax750:** 750W capacity | $200
*   **Eco600:** 600W capacity | $150
*   **Titan900:** 900W capacity | $250

Your configuration must adhere to the following technical and financial mandates:

1.  **Safety Buffer:** To prevent system failure during peak operation, the combined wattage of your chosen CPU and GPU must be at least 100W less than the total capacity of your selected PSU.
2.  **Cost Justification:** The component that consumes the highest amount of power in your build must also be the component with the highest purchase price.
3.  **Thermal Incompatibility:** The HydraPro CPU cannot be paired with the VegaLite GPU due to specific heat dissipation issues.
4.  **Voltage Regulation:** The StormZ GPU is incompatible with the Eco600 power supply.
5.  **Baseline Quality:** You are prohibited from selecting the least expensive option from all three categories simultaneously. 
6.  **Price Equilibrium:** To maintain a balanced build, the cost difference between any two selected components cannot exceed $400.
