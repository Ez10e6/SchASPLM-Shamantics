System architecture is an exercise in synergy rather than brute force. Your objective is to configure a specialized computation unit by selecting exactly one component from each of the three categories below. Success depends on adhering to strict budgetary and performance-parity protocols.

**Available Inventory:**

*   **Processors (CPU):** 
    *   FalconX: $600 | 125 performance units
    *   CoreZen: $500 | 115 performance units
    *   EcoMini: $300 | 90 performance units
*   **Graphics Cards (GPU):** 
    *   TitanZ: $700 | 135 performance units
    *   MidlineGT: $500 | 100 performance units
    *   Pixie: $400 | 95 performance units
*   **Storage Drives:** 
    *   FlashNova: $250 | 110 performance units
    *   Terabox: $300 | 100 performance units
    *   BudgetDisk: $150 | 60 performance units

**Configuration Directives:**

1.  **Median Affordability:** Identify the component in your build that possesses the middle performance score (neither the highest nor the lowest rating). This specific item must be the least expensive of the three selected parts.
2.  **High-End Restriction:** If you authorize a CPU with a price tag exceeding $500, the Pixie GPU is disqualified from the build.
3.  **Performance Variance:** The total spread between your highest-rated component and your lowest-rated component (Max Performance - Min Performance) cannot be greater than 50 units.
4.  **FlashNova Requirement:** Should you opt for the FlashNova drive, you are required to select a GPU with a performance rating of at least 100.
5.  **Price and Positioning:** 
    *   Exactly two of your chosen components must cost more than $300. 
    *   The GPU’s performance score must be the intermediate value between the CPU and the drive (meaning the GPU score must be strictly higher than one and strictly lower than the other).
