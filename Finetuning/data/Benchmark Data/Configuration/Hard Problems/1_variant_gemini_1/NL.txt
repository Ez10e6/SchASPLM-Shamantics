To configure a high-end research node for complex simulations, you must assemble a hardware stack consisting of one processor, one graphics card, and one storage module from the inventory listed below. Each component is defined by its financial cost and its performance benchmark score. Your objective is to finalize a build that adheres to several strict engineering and budgetary protocols.

### Available Hardware Inventory

**Central Processing Units (CPUs):**
*   **X9:** Benchmarks at 95 points; price is $300.
*   **ZetaCore:** Benchmarks at 120 points; price is $500.
*   **Alpha8:** Benchmarks at 110 points; price is $450.

**Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):**
*   **QuasarRTX:** Benchmarks at 130 points; price is $700.
*   **NovaX:** Benchmarks at 125 points; price is $600.
*   **GammaGTX:** Benchmarks at 90 points; price is $450.

**Storage Units:**
*   **UltraSSD:** Benchmarks at 100 points; price is $250.
*   **FusionDrive:** Benchmarks at 95 points; price is $300.
*   **MegaHDD:** Benchmarks at 60 points; price is $200.

### Configuration Protocols

1.  **Fiscal Justification:** To ensure value for money, the component with the highest price tag in your final selection must also be the component with the highest performance score in that same selection.
2.  **The Anti-Excess Rule:** You are prohibited from selecting the top-ranked item (by performance score) from all three categories simultaneously; at least one category must utilize a non-top-tier option.
3.  **Price Equilibrium:** To maintain internal consistency, the price gap between any two chosen components cannot exceed $250. Any configuration violating this variance threshold will be decommissioned.
4.  **Computational Hierarchy:** System stability requires that the GPU’s performance score never exceeds the performance score of the CPU.
5.  **Hardware Conflicts:**
    *   The **Alpha8** processor is technically incompatible with the **NovaX** GPU.
    *   The **FusionDrive** storage module is only functional when integrated with a **ZetaCore** CPU.

Determine which combination of three components satisfies every technical and financial mandate listed above.
