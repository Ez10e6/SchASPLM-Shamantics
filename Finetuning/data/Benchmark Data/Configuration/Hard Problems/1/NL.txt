When preparing a workstation tailored for data-intensive simulations, you’re expected to
select a processor, a graphics card, and a storage unit from a shortlist provided by the
procurement office. Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in
cost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be
chosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each—certain budgetary and performance
considerations are in play.
Let’s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the
highest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below
ZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices
include QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX
(90 points, $450). For storage, there’s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,
$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).
One of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be
the one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection—presumably to justify
budget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each
of the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec’d builds. There’s also a
guideline about balance: while you don’t need to match prices perfectly, no component
should differ in cost from another by more than $250. Consider that a soft constraint, they'll
reject your build if that balance is off.
Also, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you’re not
allowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement
notes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn’t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS
issues. And for some reason, the FusionDrive isn’t available unless you’re pairing it
with the ZetaCore.
Despite the abundance of high-performance hardware, you’ll need to select carefully to
stay within these constraints.
