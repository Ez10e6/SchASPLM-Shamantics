You are tasked with solving the Asprilo warehouse logistics problem.
The environment is a 2D grid containing robots, shelves, picking stations, and products.
The input specifies the initial positions of all entities, the inventory of products on shelves, and the customer orders.

The objective is to fulfill all orders within a specified time horizon.
Robots must:
1. Move through the grid to reach shelves.
2. Pick up shelves that contain the required products.
3. Transport the shelves to the designated picking stations.
4. Deliver the required quantity of products at the station.
5. Return the shelf to a storage location (or leave it at a valid spot).

Constraints:
1. Robots can move in the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).
2. Robots cannot move through obstacles or other robots (vertex and edge collision constraints).
3. A robot can carry at most one shelf at a time.
4. A shelf can be carried by at most one robot at a time.
5. Pickup and Putdown actions can only occur when a robot is at the same location as a shelf.
6. Delivery actions can only occur when a robot carrying a shelf is at a picking station.

The solution must output the sequence of actions (move, pickup, putdown, deliver) for each robot.
