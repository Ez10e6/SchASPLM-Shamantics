You are tasked with solving the Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling problem.
The goal is to schedule a set of courses into specific time periods (days and timeslots) and assign them to suitable rooms.

The schedule must satisfy the following hard constraints:
1. All lectures defined for a course must be scheduled.
2. Two lectures for the same course cannot be scheduled in the same period.
3. Lectures belonging to the same curriculum or taught by the same teacher cannot overlap in the same period.
4. No two lectures can occupy the same room in the same period.
5. Lectures cannot be scheduled in periods where the teacher is unavailable.

Additionally, the solution should minimize penalties for the following soft preferences:
1. Room Capacity: The number of students should not exceed the room capacity.
2. Minimum Working Days: Lectures for a course should be spread across a minimum number of days.
3. Isolated Lectures: Lectures in a curriculum should be adjacent to each other in a day.
4. Windows: There should not be empty gaps (windows) between lectures in a curriculum on the same day.
5. Room Stability: All lectures for a course should ideally take place in the same room.
6. Student Load: The number of lectures per day for a curriculum should be within a specified minimum and maximum range.
7. Travel Distance: Consecutive lectures in a curriculum should not take place in different buildings.
8. Room Suitability: Courses should be scheduled in rooms that satisfy their specific constraints.
9. Double Lectures: If a course requires grouped lectures, they should be scheduled together.
