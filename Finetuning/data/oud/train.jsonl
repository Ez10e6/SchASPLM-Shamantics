The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$).

Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4.

We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind. If you find multiple ways to satisfy all these rules, our first priority is to maximize the number of rooms in use during each session to give the event a high-energy feel. After that, we want to minimize the total number of idle room-time slots across the four days, provided it doesn't conflict with any of the other requirements.

Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible.

Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert AI researcher. Translate the following natural language problem description into syntactically correct clingo ASP code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Our mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. \n\nAs we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time.

Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed.

If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums. At least two different topics must be represented in any slot where lectures are occurring.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** When determining the ideal layout among multiple valid configurations:\n    1.  First, prioritize the schedule that utilizes the highest number of auditoriums simultaneously during each session.\n    2.  Second, prioritize the arrangement that results in the fewest total empty auditorium-time slots throughout the four-day event, provided it complies with the non-consecutive usage rule."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "% There are 10 presentations.\npresentation(1..10).\n\n% Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR.\ntopic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(P, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- presentation(P).\n\n% The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day.\nday(1..4).\nslot(1..4).\n\n% There are 5 rooms.\nroom(1..5).\n\n% Each presentation must be scheduled.\n1 { scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : room(R), slot(Sl), day(D) } :- presentation(P).\n\n% Only one presentation per room\u2011time.\n:- scheduled(P1, R, Sl, D), scheduled(P2, R, Sl, D), P1 != P2.\n\n% Each room can be used at most three times per day.\n{ scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : presentation(P), slot(Sl) } 3 :- room(R), day(D).\n\n% Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots.\n:- scheduled(_, R, Sl1, D), scheduled(_, R, Sl2, D), Sl1 = Sl2 - 1.\n\n% Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector.\n-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"AI\", -projector(R).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"Cloud\", -projector(R).\n\n% VR cannot be in room 1.\n:- scheduled(P, 1, _, _), topicOf(P, \"VR\").\n\n% IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days.\nhasIoT(D) :- scheduled(P, _, _, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { D : hasIoT(D) } < 3.\n\n% VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room.\n:- scheduled(P1, R, _, D), scheduled(P2, R, _, D),\n   topicOf(P1, \"VR\"), topicOf(P2, \"AI\").\n\n% At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot.\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- day(D), slot(S), #count { P : cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) } > 2.\n\n% Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1.\n:- scheduled(P, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(P, \"AI\").\n\n% Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4.\n:- scheduled(P, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(P, \"VR\").\n\n% Each day must have at least one presentation.\n:- day(D), not scheduled(_, _, _, D).\n\n% At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms.\nhasTopic(T, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, T).\n:- slot(Sl), day(D), #count { T : hasTopic(T, Sl, D) } < 2.\n\n% Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots.\nused(R, Sl, D) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl, D).\nroomsUsed(N, Sl, D) :- N = #count { R : used(R, Sl, D) }, slot(Sl), day(D).\n#maximize { N@2 : roomsUsed(N, Sl, D) }.\n\nidle(R, Sl, D) :- room(R), slot(Sl), day(D), not used(R, Sl, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, Sl, D: idle(R, Sl, D) }.\n#minimize { N@1: num_idle(N) }."}]}

Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration.

The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate.

However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities.

We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.\n\nEvery movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system.

The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.

Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400.

Each presentation $p_i$ is associated with exactly one domain $k$ from the set $K = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (C), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR)}\\}$. \n\nThe event occurs over a temporal horizon of four days, $D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with each day partitioned into four discrete, sequential sessions: $S = \\{\\text{early morning}, \\text{late morning}, \\text{early afternoon}, \\text{late afternoon}\\}$. Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4. Boundary Conditions\n*   **Initialization:** The session $(d=1, s=\\text{early morning})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{AI\\}$ domain.\n*   **Termination:** The session $(d=4, s=\\text{early afternoon})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{VR\\}$ domain.\n\n### 5. Optimization Objectives\nIn the event that multiple feasible schedules exist, the optimal schedule shall be determined by the following lexicographical preference order:\n1.  **Maximize Spatial Parallelism:** Maximize the number of rooms utilized during each active session $(d, s)$.\n2.  **Maximize Efficiency:** Minimize the total number of idle (unassigned) room-time slots across the global schedule, subject to the preservation of all primary constraints.\n\n**Task:**\nFormalize the above as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4.

If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500.

The drone will launch from the designated LaunchPad with its 16-liter internal tank capacity fully available. Every action the drone takes\u2014whether it is moving through a tunnel, collecting a sample, or performing a refill\u2014is considered a single \"event,\" and the entire mission must be completed within a strict limit of 18 total events and a maximum duration of 10 minutes.\n\nThe aqueducts are one-way tunnels, and navigating them is taxing on the drone\u2019s resources. Moving through any tunnel takes exactly one minute and consumes a specific volume of the drone's tank capacity. From the LaunchPad, the drone can enter Tunnel 1, which costs 2 liters, or Tunnel 2, which costs 3 liters. Tunnel 1 leads directly to Station A, while Tunnel 2 provides access to either Station B or a specialized calibration shaft known as CalibEdge. If the drone is at Station A, it can proceed through Tunnel 3 (at a cost of 1 liter) to loop back into the entrance of Tunnel 2. If it is at the CalibEdge, it can move into Station C at a cost of 2 liters. Finally, Station C funnels back into the entrance of Tunnel 1, though this return trip is quite heavy, costing 2 liters of volume.\n\nSampling itself is a delicate process. Collecting a single sample at any station takes one minute and consumes 1 liter of the remaining tank capacity. To prevent cross-contamination, the drone is strictly prohibited from taking two samples at the same station consecutively. While the 16-liter capacity is limited, the drone can recover 3 liters of capacity by idling for two consecutive minutes at the CalibEdge; however, this refill procedure can only be performed once during the mission.\n\nThe mission's success depends on meeting specific deadlines. We are required to collect at least one sample from both Station A and Station B. The first sample at Station A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark. While Station C is an optional target, the drone is only permitted to collect a sample there if, and only if, the mandatory samples from both Station A and Station B are successfully completed within the first 8 minutes of the mission. \n\nOur primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected, including the optional one at Station C. If we can achieve the same number of samples using different routes, our secondary priority is to choose the path that completes the final mandatory sample at the earliest possible time.
