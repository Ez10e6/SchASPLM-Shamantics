Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.\n\nAs we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly.

The set of undirected edges $E$ is defined by the following adjacency relations:\n*   $S_1$ is adjacent to $\\{J_1, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_1$ is adjacent to $\\{A, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_2$ is adjacent to $\\{B, J_1\\}$\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Task Requirements:** The agent must perform an inspection operation at both $A$ and $B$ at least once. An inspection is defined as a stationary action performed at a target vertex.\n2.  **Energy Model:** \n    *   **Traversal Cost:** The transition between any two adjacent vertices $u, v \\in V$ incurs a constant energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Action Cost:** Each inspection operation performed at $A$ or $B$ incurs an energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Capacity:** The agent is initialized with a total energy budget of $E_{max} = 8 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n3.  **Signal Interference Constraint:** Let $P = (v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ be the sequence of vertices visited by the agent. If there exists an index $i$ such that $v_i = J_2$ and $v_k \\neq A$ for all $k < i$, then the sub-path $(v_i, \\dots, A)$ leading to the first inspection of $A$ must not traverse $J_1$ if $J_1 \\in \\{v_0, \\dots, v_{i-1}\\}$.

We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields.

For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100.

Consider a selection problem where an engineer must choose exactly one entity from each of three disjoint sets of components: Central Processing Units ($\\mathcal{C}$), Graphics Processing Units ($\\mathcal{G}$), and Storage Drives ($\\mathcal{D}$). Each component $i$ is defined by a cost attribute $p_i$ (in USD) and a performance metric $v_i$ (in points).\n\nThe available component specifications are provided in the following tables:\n\n**Table 1: CPUs ($\\mathcal{C}$)**\n| Component ($c$) | Cost ($p_c$) | Performance ($v_c$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| FalconX | \\$600 | 125 |\n| CoreZen | \\$500 | 115 |\n| EcoMini | \\$300 | 90 |\n\n**Table 2: GPUs ($\\mathcal{G}$)**\n| Component ($g$) | Cost ($p_g$) | Performance ($v_g$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| TitanZ | \\$700 | 135 |\n| MidlineGT | \\$500 | 100 |\n| Pixie | \\$400 | 95 |\n\n**Table 3: Storage Drives ($\\mathcal{D}$)**\n| Component ($d$) | Cost ($p_d$) | Performance ($v_d$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| FlashNova | \\$250 | 110 |\n| Terabox | \\$300 | 100 |\n| BudgetDisk | \\$150 | 60 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nA valid system configuration $S = \\{c, g, d\\}$ must satisfy the following six conditions:\n\n1.  **Strict Performance Intermediate:** The performance metric of the GPU ($v_g$) must strictly reside between the performance metrics of the CPU ($v_c$) and the Storage Drive ($v_d$). That is, $v_g \\neq \\max(v_c, v_g, v_d)$ and $v_g \\neq \\min(v_c, v_g, v_d)$.\n2.  **Median Cost Minimality:** The component $i \\in S$ possessing the median performance value must also satisfy the condition $p_i = \\min(p_c, p_g, p_d)$.\n3.  **Conditional GPU Exclusion:** If $p_c > 500$, then $g \\neq \\text{Pixie}$.\n4.  **Performance Variance Limitation:** The performance spread, defined as $\\max(v_c, v_g, v_d) - \\min(v_c, v_g, v_d)$, must not exceed 50 units.\n5.  **Subsystem Dependency:** If $d = \\text{FlashNova}$, then $v_g \\geq 100$.\n6.  **Cardinality of High-Cost Components:** The set of components $\\{i \\in S \\mid p_i > 300\\}$ must have a cardinality of exactly 2.\n\n**Required:**\nDetermine the feasible configuration(s) that satisfy all aforementioned constraints.
