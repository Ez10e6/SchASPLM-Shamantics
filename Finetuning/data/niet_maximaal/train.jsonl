Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe have a significant puzzle to solve regarding the upcoming two-day research symposium. We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields. If we can balance these technical quirks and room capacities, we\u2019ll have a seamless program that serves both our presenters and our guests."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars are on AI, Bio, Math, or Chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Bio\"; \"Math\"; \"Chem\").\n1{topicOf(S, T): topic(T)}1 :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 4 time slots per day over two days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1; 2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The time slots are morining, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\"; \"late morning\"; \"early afternoon\"; \"late afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 5 Rooms are used"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Every seminar must be delivered"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{delivered(S, R, T, D) : room(R), timeslot(T), day(D)} :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one sesion in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, T, D), delivered(S2, R, T, D), S1 != S2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms can only be used twice in a day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{delivered(S, R, T, D) : seminar(S), timeslot(T)}2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms can not be used twice in a row"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "follows(\"morning\",\"late morning\";\"late morning\",\n\"early afternoon\";\"early afternoon\", \"late afternoon\").\n:- delivered(_, R, T1, _), delivered(_, R, T2, _), follows(T1, T2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 3 is not available in the afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(_, R, T, _), R = 3, T = \"early afternoon\"; T = \"late afternoon\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 5 doesn't have a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(R) :- room(R), R = 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI and Math require a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), -projector(R).\n:- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"Math\"), -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI can only be in the morning or late morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, _, T, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), T != \"morning\", T != \"late morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio sessions must be spread across both days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasBio(D) :- delivered(S, _, _, D), topicOf(S, \"Bio\").\n:- day(D), not hasBio(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio sessions can not happen at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two Chem sessions can happen in the same room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, _), delivered(S2, R, _, _), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The first and last sessions must be Math"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "firstSession(\"morning\", 1).\nlastSession(\"late afternoon\", 2).\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), firstSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}.\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), lastSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Do not waste any timeslots in rooms unless necessary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wastedSlot(R, T, D) :- not delivered(_, R, T, D), room(R), timeslot(T), day(D).\nwastedSlots(N) :- #count{R, T, D: wastedSlot(R, T, D)} = N.\n#minimize{N: wastedSlots(N)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most 2 Bio and Chem Sessions may overlap"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "overlap(T, D) :- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\").\n{ overlap(T, D) : timeslot(T), day(D) }2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each timeslot should have seminars from as many topics as possible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(To, T, D) :- delivered(S, _, T, D), topicOf(S, To).\ntopicsPerSlot(N, T, D) :- #count{To: hasTopic(To, T, D)} = N, timeslot(T), day(D).\n#maximize{N: topicsPerSlot(N, T, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio and Chem may not happen in the same room on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, D), delivered(S2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}]}

The event is spread across two days, with each day broken down into three specific time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon. We have four rooms at our disposal for these sessions, but keep in mind that a room can only host one seminar during any single time slot.\n\nWhen you start mapping out the topics\u2014AI, Biology, and Math\u2014there are several departmental requirements we have to honor. The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.\n\nWe also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you\u2019ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nFinally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot. Additionally, for Seminars 6 and 7, the organizers have requested that they both be held in the exact same room, though they must be scheduled on different days to give the attendees some breathing room between the two sessions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars have topics: AI, Bio, or Math"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Bio\"; \"Math\").\n1{topicOf(S, T): topic(T)}1 :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 2 days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1; 2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 3 time slots per day: morning, midday, afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 4 rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one seminar can be scheduled in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{scheduled(S, R, T, D): room(R), timeslot(T), day(D)} :- seminar(S).\n:- schedule(S1, D, T, R), schedule(S2, D, T, R), S1 != S2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI seminars must be in the morning or midday"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(S, _, \"afternoon\", _), topicOf(S, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio seminars must happen in at least 2 different rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "bioRoom(R) :- scheduled(S,_,_,R), topicOf(S, \"Bio\").\n:- #count { R : bioRoom(R) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 4 is not available at midday on either day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 4, \"midday\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two Math seminars can happen at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(S1, _, T, D), scheduled(S2, _, T, D), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Math\"), topicOf(S2, \"Math\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminar 5 must happen on Day 2 but not in the morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{scheduled(5, R, T, 2): T != \"morning\", timeslot(T), room(R)}1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars 6 and 7 must happen in the same room but on different days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(6,R1,T1,D1), scheduled(7,R2,T2,D2), R1 != R2.\n:- scheduled(6,R,T1,D), scheduled(7,R,T2,D)."}]}

The event unfolds over four days, and each day is\nstructured into four distinct sessions: early morning, late morning, early\nafternoon, and late afternoon. A total of five rooms are available throughout\nthe event.\nEach of the ten presentations must be scheduled \u2014 no omissions \u2014 and\nonly one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT\npresentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they\ncan\u2019t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids\nAI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day \u2014 those topics\nmust not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.\nYou\u2019ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely\nrelated topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not\nexcessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the\nsame time slot, regardless of room.\nA few time-critical constraints must be obeyed. The first scheduled session on Day 1,\noccurring in the early morning, must be an AI presentation \u2014 no other topic is\npermitted to occupy that slot. At the other end of the schedule, the early afternoon\nsession on Day 4 must be reserved exclusively for VR; no other topic may take that\nposition.\nTo ensure consistent coverage and audience engagement, each day must include at least\none presentation, even if others remain unassigned. And each time slot, across all\nrooms, should exhibit at least two different topics \u2014 no slot should be monopolized\nby a single subject area.\nFinally, when multiple valid schedules satisfy all the constraints, preference should\nbe given to those that maximize the number of rooms in use during each session.\nOnce that\u2019s achieved, the next priority is to minimize idle room-time slots overall,\nwithout violating any rule that would otherwise disqualify a more efficient layout."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 presentations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each presentation must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : room(R), slot(Sl), day(D) } :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one presentation per room\u2011time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, Sl, D), scheduled(P2, R, Sl, D), P1 != P2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each day must have at least one presentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), not scheduled(_, _, _, D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(D) :- scheduled(P, _, _, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { D : hasIoT(D) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, _, D), scheduled(P2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(P1, \"VR\"), topicOf(P2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, R, Sl1, D), scheduled(_, R, Sl2, D), Sl1 = Sl2 - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- day(D), slot(S), #count { P : cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most three times per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : presentation(P), slot(Sl) } 3 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, Sl, D) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl, D).\nroomsUsed(N, Sl, D) :- N = #count { R : used(R, Sl, D) }, slot(Sl), day(D).\n#maximize { N@2 : roomsUsed(N, Sl, D) }.\nidle(R, Sl, D) :- room(R), slot(Sl), day(D), not used(R, Sl, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, Sl, D: idle(R, Sl, D) }.\n#minimize { N@1: num_idle(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(P, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"AI\", -projector(R).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"Cloud\", -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR cannot be in room 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, 1, _, _), topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(P, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(T, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, T).\n:- slot(Sl), day(D), #count { T : hasTopic(T, Sl, D) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}]}

The probe must conclude its mission within a 10-minute operational window.\n\n**Navigation and Resource Costs:**\nThe cavern is structured as a network of sectors and waypoints. Fluid consumption varies based on the thermal intensity of the path:\n*   **From Deployment Hub:** The probe can enter either Sector-Alpha (2 units) or Sector-Beta (3 units).\n*   **Sector-Alpha:** Leads to Waypoint-A (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-A:** Following data retrieval, the probe can move through a bypass (1 unit) to reach Sector-Beta.\n*   **Sector-Beta:** This hub branches to either Waypoint-B (1 unit) or the Calibration-Sump (2 units).\n*   **Calibration-Sump:** This location leads to Waypoint-C (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-C:** Offers a return path to Sector-Alpha (2 units).\n\n**Data Collection Protocols:**\n*   **Mandatory Sites:** The probe is required to secure one data sample from Waypoint-A and one from Waypoint-B. \n*   **Waypoint-A Deadline:** Due to atmospheric instability, the sample at Waypoint-A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n*   **Waypoint-C (Conditional):** Retrieval at Waypoint-C is required if, and only if, the primary samples (A and B) are both secured within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n*   **Extraction Mechanics:** Each sampling operation takes 1 minute to complete. During this time, the probe\u2019s recycling system recovers 1 unit of thermal fluid from the environment. To prevent sensor fouling, the probe cannot perform two extraction operations consecutively at the same waypoint.\n\n**Maintenance and Limitations:**\n*   **The Calibration-Sump:** This site contains a unique recharge port. If the probe remains stationary here for 2 consecutive minutes, it replenishes 3 units of thermal fluid. This recharge can be performed only once before the port seals.\n*   **Mobility:** Every relocation between any two connected nodes takes exactly 1 minute. The probe must follow the established directional flow of the network.\n*   **Action Cap:** To prevent mechanical fatigue, the probe is limited to a maximum of 18 total discrete actions (moves, extractions, or recharges).\n\n**Mission Optimization:**\nThe primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples retrieved. Should different navigational paths yield the same number of samples, the mission profile that completes the mandatory extractions (Waypoint-A and Waypoint-B) in the shortest elapsed time will be selected as the optimal route."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start at launchpad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement: 1\u202fmin per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(S, V8): loc(S) }1 :- time(V8).\n:- at(E, V8), at(Deadline, V8+1), not edge(E, Deadline, _), E != Deadline."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Tank Capacity: 16\u202fL."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(Maintenance+1, V18) :- tank(Maintenance, V9), at(O,Maintenance), at(B,Maintenance+1), edge(O,B,V12), V18 = V9 - V12.\n:- tank(_, V3), V3 < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB (exactly once each)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",V6): time(V6) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",V6): time(V6) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",V6): time(V6) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling: 1\u202fmin, +1\u202fL per sample."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(V18,V12) :- sampled(V18,V12).\nat(V18,V12+1) :- sampled(V18,V12).\ntank(V12+1,Optimization+1) :- tank(V12,Optimization), sampled(V18,V12), Optimization<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Refill at CalibEdge: 2 min \u2192 +3L, at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(V3) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",V3), at(\"CalibEdge\",V3+1).\n:- refill(V14), refill(V4), V14 != V4.\ntank(V3+2, A + 3) :- tank(V3,A), refill(V3), A < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(V1,Action), sampled(V1,V13), V13 = Action+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationA must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",V8): time(V8), V8 <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",N), sampled(\"StationB\",O), max(N,O) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Event Limit: \u2264 18 events (moves + samples + refill)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(V15) :- at(Q,V15-1), at(Martian,V15), Q != Martian.\nevent(V15) :- sampled(_,V15).\nevent(V15) :- refill(V15).\n:- Calibration = #count {Protocols: event(Protocols)}, Calibration>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Primary: maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(V1) :- V1 = #count {During: sampled(Mobility,During)}.\n#maximize { V1@2: samples(V1) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Secondary: minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(Optimization) :- Optimization = #min{H: sampled(\"StationA\",Due), sampled(\"StationB\",Mobility), H>=Due, H>=Mobility, time(H) }.\n#minimize { Optimization@1: mtime(Optimization) }."}]}

The layout of this network is quite specific: from our starting position at point 1, the drone can fly directly to either point 2 or point 3, but point 4 is a bit more isolated and can only be reached by traveling through point 2. Because of the way the navigation system is programmed, the drone is strictly limited to moving between these directly adjacent locations.\n\nThe mission objective is to ensure that both point 3 and point 4 are scanned during the flight, though the drone operator can decide which of those two targets to visit first. Timing is the most rigid part of this operation; the drone\u2019s flight path must last for exactly five time units. Since every single move from one point to the next consumes exactly one unit of time, the drone will need to make a total of five hops across the network. The mission begins at point 1, and the drone must navigate the connections efficiently enough to cover both required scan sites within that precise five-move window."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 4 Locations"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Adjacent nodes: (1\u20132), (1\u20133), (2\u20134)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(1, 2).\nedge(1, 3).\nedge(2, 4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can only move between adjacent nodes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), time(T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 timesteps"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit locations: 3, 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(3, _).\nat(4, _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(1, 0)."}]}

Each day is partitioned into a set of three contiguous time slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$, representing morning, midday, and afternoon, respectively. The workshops are conducted within a set of three distinct venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to a specific subject category $s \\in S$, where $S = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}, \\text{Mathematics (M)}, \\text{Biology (B)}\\}$. An assignment is defined as a mapping of a workshop to a unique triplet $(d, t, r) \\in D \\times T \\times R$.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n1.  **Exclusivity and Capacity Constraints:**\n    *   **Unit Occupancy:** For any given $(d, t, r)$, at most one workshop $w \\in W$ may be scheduled.\n    *   **Daily Room Bound:** For each room $r \\in R$ on any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled workshops $n_{d,r}$ must satisfy $1 \\le n_{d,r} \\le 2$. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one time slot per day.\n    *   **Venue Availability:** Room $r_2$ is restricted such that no workshops may be scheduled during $t_3$ on either $d_1$ or $d_2$.\n\n2.  **Subject-Specific Temporal and Spatial Constraints:**\n    *   **AI Temporal Restriction:** Workshops where $s = \\text{AI}$ must be scheduled exclusively during the morning slot $t_1$.\n    *   **Mathematics Non-Concurrency:** Let $W_M \\subset W$ be the subset of workshops where $s = \\text{M}$. For any $w_i, w_j \\in W_M$ ($i \\neq j$), the assigned time slots $(d_i, t_i)$ and $(d_j, t_j)$ must be distinct. No two Mathematics workshops may occur simultaneously, regardless of room assignment.\n    *   **Subject Segregation:** For any day $d \\in D$ and room $r \\in R$, the room may not host both a workshop of subject AI and a workshop of subject B. If an AI workshop is assigned to $(d, r, t_i)$, then no Biology workshop may be assigned to $(d, r, t_j)$ for any $t_j \\in T$, and vice versa.\n\n3.  **Distributional Requirements:**\n    *   **Daily Subject Coverage:** For each day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each subject category $s \\in S$. \n\n**Objective:**\nIdentify a feasible schedule that satisfies all aforementioned logical and physical constraints. In the event of multiple feasible solutions, the optimal schedule is defined as the one that maximizes the utilization of available spatio-temporal slots (minimizing the cardinality of the set of unused valid room-time pairs).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400.

Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are preparing to deploy a water-sampling drone into the subterranean aqueduct network, and there are several operational parameters you need to keep in mind for this mission. The drone will launch from the designated LaunchPad with its 16-liter internal tank capacity fully available. Every action the drone takes\u2014whether it is moving through a tunnel, collecting a sample, or performing a refill\u2014is considered a single \"event,\" and the entire mission must be completed within a strict limit of 18 total events and a maximum duration of 10 minutes.\n\nThe aqueducts are one-way tunnels, and navigating them is taxing on the drone\u2019s resources. Moving through any tunnel takes exactly one minute and consumes a specific volume of the drone's tank capacity. From the LaunchPad, the drone can enter Tunnel 1, which costs 2 liters, or Tunnel 2, which costs 3 liters. Tunnel 1 leads directly to Station A, while Tunnel 2 provides access to either Station B or a specialized calibration shaft known as CalibEdge. If the drone is at Station A, it can proceed through Tunnel 3 (at a cost of 1 liter) to loop back into the entrance of Tunnel 2. If it is at the CalibEdge, it can move into Station C at a cost of 2 liters. Finally, Station C funnels back into the entrance of Tunnel 1, though this return trip is quite heavy, costing 2 liters of volume.\n\nSampling itself is a delicate process. Collecting a single sample at any station takes one minute and consumes 1 liter of the remaining tank capacity. To prevent cross-contamination, the drone is strictly prohibited from taking two samples at the same station consecutively. While the 16-liter capacity is limited, the drone can recover 3 liters of capacity by idling for two consecutive minutes at the CalibEdge; however, this refill procedure can only be performed once during the mission.\n\nThe mission's success depends on meeting specific deadlines. We are required to collect at least one sample from both Station A and Station B. The first sample at Station A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark. While Station C is an optional target, the drone is only permitted to collect a sample there if, and only if, the mandatory samples from both Station A and Station B are successfully completed within the first 8 minutes of the mission. \n\nOur primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected, including the optional one at Station C. If we can achieve the same number of samples using different routes, our secondary priority is to choose the path that completes the final mandatory sample at the earliest possible time. All operations must conclude by the 10-minute deadline without ever exceeding the 16-liter tank limit."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Locations: HubWest, NodeA, NodeB, Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"HubWest\"; \"NodeA\"; \"NodeB\"; \"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Edges: (HubWest\u2013NodeA), (HubWest\u2013NodeB), (NodeA\u2013Sensor1), (NodeB\u2013Sensor2), (NodeA\u2013NodeB)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeA\").\nedge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeB\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"Sensor1\").\nedge(\"NodeB\", \"Sensor2\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"NodeB\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Max duration: 9 minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..9)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start location: HubWest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"HubWest\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes costs 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling targets: Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "inspect(\"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each sample requires a full minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(L, T) : time(T) } 1 :- inspect(L).\nat(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize time by which both samples are completed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "latest_inspect(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(_, T1) }.\n#minimize { T : latest_inspect(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: A minimum of three timesteps between samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- inspect_at(_, T1), inspect_at(_, T2), 0 < T1 - T2 < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If NodeB is visited before Sensor1, then NodeA may not be visited afterward"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeB\", T1), at(\"Sensor1\", T2), at(\"NodeA\", T3), T1 < T2 < T3."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. \n\nAs we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time. Finally, keep in mind that the drone is limited to a maximum of 20 total stops throughout the mission, a count that includes every minute spent traveling, scanning, or idling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}

Each day is partitioned into a set of three contiguous time slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$, representing morning, midday, and afternoon, respectively. The workshops are conducted within a set of three distinct venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to a specific subject category $s \\in S$, where $S = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}, \\text{Mathematics (M)}, \\text{Biology (B)}\\}$. An assignment is defined as a mapping of a workshop to a unique triplet $(d, t, r) \\in D \\times T \\times R$.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n1.  **Exclusivity and Capacity Constraints:**\n    *   **Unit Occupancy:** For any given $(d, t, r)$, at most one workshop $w \\in W$ may be scheduled.\n    *   **Daily Room Bound:** For each room $r \\in R$ on any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled workshops $n_{d,r}$ must satisfy $1 \\le n_{d,r} \\le 2$. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one time slot per day.\n    *   **Venue Availability:** Room $r_2$ is restricted such that no workshops may be scheduled during $t_3$ on either $d_1$ or $d_2$.\n\n2.  **Subject-Specific Temporal and Spatial Constraints:**\n    *   **AI Temporal Restriction:** Workshops where $s = \\text{AI}$ must be scheduled exclusively during the morning slot $t_1$.\n    *   **Mathematics Non-Concurrency:** Let $W_M \\subset W$ be the subset of workshops where $s = \\text{M}$. For any $w_i, w_j \\in W_M$ ($i \\neq j$), the assigned time slots $(d_i, t_i)$ and $(d_j, t_j)$ must be distinct. No two Mathematics workshops may occur simultaneously, regardless of room assignment.\n    *   **Subject Segregation:** For any day $d \\in D$ and room $r \\in R$, the room may not host both a workshop of subject AI and a workshop of subject B. If an AI workshop is assigned to $(d, r, t_i)$, then no Biology workshop may be assigned to $(d, r, t_j)$ for any $t_j \\in T$, and vice versa.\n\n3.  **Distributional Requirements:**\n    *   **Daily Subject Coverage:** For each day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each subject category $s \\in S$. \n\n**Objective:**\nIdentify a feasible schedule that satisfies all aforementioned logical and physical constraints. In the event of multiple feasible solutions, the optimal schedule is defined as the one that maximizes the utilization of available spatio-temporal slots (minimizing the cardinality of the set of unused valid room-time pairs).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Define the decision variables for the scheduling problem.\n2.  Provide a formal mapping of the eight workshops to the coordinates $(d, t, r)$.\n3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are currently finalizing the layout for our upcoming three-day symposium, which will feature a total of twelve workshops spread across four key disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Mathematics, and Linguistics. The event is hosted in a venue with four rooms, and each day is structured into three distinct sessions consisting of a morning, a midday, and an evening slot. Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.\n\nAs we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly. No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.\n\nThematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.\n\nTo keep the daily schedule organized, we\u2019ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won\u2019t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.\n\nOur objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules. We want to fill as many of the available slots as the logic allows, ensuring the symposium is as robust as possible while respecting every constraint."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Workshops and Topics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..12).\ntopic(\"AI\"; \"Physics\"; \"Math\"; \"Linguistics\").\n1 { topicOf(W, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: All Math workshops must be scheduled in Room 1 or Room 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, R, _, _), topicOf(W, \"Math\"), R != 1, R != 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Linguistics workshops must not overlap in time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, _, S, D), scheduled(W2, _, S, D), topicOf(W1, \"Linguistics\"),\ntopicOf(W2, \"Linguistics\"), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No room may host workshops from different topics on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, _, D), scheduled(W2, R, _, D), topicOf(W1, T1),\ntopicOf(W2, T2), T1 != T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: First workshop must be AI"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- wTime(W, I), minTime(I), not topicOf(W, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most 2 sessions per room per day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{scheduled(W, R, S, D) : workshop(W), slot(S)} 2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No room can be used in adjacent time slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "adjacent(\"morning\", \"midday\").\nadjacent(\"midday\", \"evening\").\n:- scheduled(_, R, S1, D), scheduled(_, R, S2, D), adjacent(S1, S2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Time encoding for total ordering"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "slotOrder(\"morning\", 1).\nslotOrder(\"midday\", 2).\nslotOrder(\"evening\", 3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least one workshop per topic must occur each day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), topic(T), not scheduled(_, _, _, D) : topicOf(_, T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one workshop per room per time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, S, D), scheduled(W2, R, S, D), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 4 cannot host AI or Physics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, 4, _, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\").\n:- scheduled(W, 4, _, _), topicOf(W, \"Physics\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Every workshop must be scheduled"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 {scheduled(W, R, S, D) : room(R), slot(S), day(D)} :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Physics workshops must be held on the first or second day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, _, D), topicOf(W, \"Physics\"), D = 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 cannot be used in the evening"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 2, \"evening\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Time and Structure"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..3).\nslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"evening\").\nroom(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Compute time index"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeIndex(D, S, I) :- day(D), slot(S), slotOrder(S, O), I = (D - 1) * 3 + O."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Find the minimum and maximum index among all scheduled workshops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "minTime(I) :- I = #min {J : wTime(_, J)}.\nmaxTime(I) :- I = #max {J : wTime(_, J)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Assign each scheduled workshop its time index"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wTime(W, I) :- scheduled(W, _, S, D), timeIndex(D, S, I)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize idle slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "idle(R, S, D) :- room(R), slot(S), day(D), not used(R, S, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, S, D: idle(R, S, D) }.\n#minimize { N: num_idle(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI workshops must be in the morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, S, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\"), S != \"morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used in each time slot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, S, D) :- scheduled(_, R, S, D).\nroomsUsed(N, S, D) :- N = #count{R : used(R, S, D)}, slot(S), day(D).\n#maximize {N : roomsUsed(N, S, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Last workshop must be Linguistics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- wTime(W, I), maxTime(I), not topicOf(W, \"Linguistics\")."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nA logistical framework is required to coordinate a four-day symposium featuring ten distinct lectures. These presentations are categorized into four specialized tracks: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Cloud Computing (CC)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Virtual Reality (VR)**. \n\nThe itinerary consists of four daily cycles, each divided into four specific time blocks: Early Morning, Late Morning, Early Afternoon, and Late Afternoon. To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.\n\n### Foundational Protocols\n1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.\n2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.\n3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.\n4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but we need to make sure the final configuration respects every one of these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: components cpus  x9 zetacore alpha8 gpus  quasarrtx novax gammagtxstorage  ultrassd megahdd fusiondrive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select exactly one cpu one gpu and one storage device"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu costs x9 300 zetacore 500 alpha8 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu costs quasarrtx 700 novax 600 gammagtx 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage costs ultrassd 250 megahdd 200 fusiondrive 300"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu performance x9 95 zetacore 120 alpha8 110"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu performance quasarrtx 130 novax 125 gammagtx 90"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage performance ultrassd 100 megahdd 60 fusiondrive 95"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: you may not select all three topperforming components"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the selected gpu must not have higher performance than the selected cpu"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: alpha8 is incompatible with novax"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: fusiondrive can only be used with zetacore"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nA marine survey drone emerges from SubDock into a labyrinth of \nundersea currents that define a bidirectional routing graph. \nEach current lane exacts a heat load on the drone\u2019s systems rather than \nbattery measured in heat units and all traversals take one time unit. \nThe drone starts with a maximum heat tolerance of 10\u202funits; every movement \nalong a lane adds its heat load, and it can shed all heat by lingering in \na cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\nFrom SubDock, the drone may navigate the gentle CoralPass (2\u202funits) or the \nturbulent VentStream (4\u202funits). CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap.

Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible. While we must strictly adhere to all these rules, we want to minimize the number of unused room-time slots across the two-day period."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 8 graduate workshops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: workshops are in ai math or bio"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Math\"; \"Bio\").\n1 {topicOf(W, T) : topic(T)} 1 :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 2 days with 3 time slots per day morning midday and afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..2).\nslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 3 rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each workshop must be scheduled"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 {scheduled(W, R, S, D) : room(R), slot(S), day(D)} :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only one workshop can be in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, S, D), scheduled(W2, R, S, D), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each room can be used at most twice per day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{scheduled(W, R, S, D) : workshop(W), slot(S)} 2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: room 2 is not available in the afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 2, \"afternoon\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ai workshops must be in the morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, S, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\"), S != \"morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no two math workshops can be scheduled at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, _, S, D), scheduled(W2, _, S, D), topicOf(W1, \"Math\"), topicOf(W2, \"Math\"), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bio and ai cannot be in the same room on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, _, D), scheduled(W2, R, _, D), topicOf(W1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(W2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: at least one workshop of each topic must be held on each day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), topic(T), not scheduled(W, _, _, D) : topicOf(W, T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: try to minimize idle room slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, S, D) :- scheduled(_, R, S, D).\nidle(R, S, D) :- room(R), slot(S), day(D), not used(R, S, D).\n#minimize {1, R, S, D : idle(R, S, D)}."}]}

For any pair of lectures $(l_i, l_j)$, if $f(l_i) = \\text{Mathematics}$ and $f(l_j) = \\text{Physics}$, their assigned rooms must be disjoint, regardless of the temporal component. That is:\n$$\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_j))$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}$ denotes the projection of the assignment onto the set of rooms.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

The venue provides four separate halls for these presentations.\n\n**Temporal and Spatial Structure**\n*   **Daily Schedule:** Each day is divided into three blocks: Morning, Midday, and Evening.\n*   **Room Capacity:** A single hall cannot host more than two presentations in a single day.\n*   **Buffer Rule:** Consecutive sessions in the same hall are prohibited; if a hall is used twice in one day, an empty block must serve as a buffer between those sessions.\n*   **Hall-Specific Restrictions:** \n    *   Hall 2 is unavailable during all Evening blocks.\n    *   Hall 4 is strictly prohibited from hosting any AI or Physics presentations.\n\n**Disciplinary Constraints**\n*   **AI:** These sessions are restricted exclusively to Morning blocks.\n*   **Physics:** These sessions may only be scheduled on Day 1 or Day 2; they are barred from the final day.\n*   **Mathematics:** These sessions must be held in either Hall 1 or Hall 3.\n*   **Linguistics:** To ensure maximum attendance, no two Linguistics sessions may occur simultaneously.\n\n**Operational Mandates**\n*   **Categorical Isolation:** To maintain thematic focus, each hall is restricted to a single discipline per day. You may not mix different subjects in the same room on the same day.\n*   **Daily Diversity:** Every day of the conference must include at least one session from each of the four disciplines.\n*   **Fixed Milestones:** \n    *   The conference must open (Day 1, Morning) with an AI session.\n    *   The conference must conclude (Day 3, Evening) with a Linguistics session.\n\n**Optimization Goal**\nYour objective is to populate the schedule with the twelve required sessions while maximizing the use of available halls across all time blocks. You must minimize vacant slots without violating any of the physical or logical boundaries established above.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nA marine survey drone emerges from SubDock into a labyrinth of \nundersea currents that define a bidirectional routing graph. \nEach current lane exacts a heat load on the drone\u2019s systems rather than \nbattery measured in heat units and all traversals take one time unit. \nThe drone starts with a maximum heat tolerance of 10\u202funits; every movement \nalong a lane adds its heat load, and it can shed all heat by lingering in \na cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\nFrom SubDock, the drone may navigate the gentle CoralPass (2\u202funits) or the \nturbulent VentStream (4\u202funits). CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap.

The agent must execute a sequence of operations\u2014comprising movement, resource acquisition, and site sampling\u2014subject to strict temporal, resource, and logical constraints.\n\n**System Specifications**\n1.  **Graph Topology**: The vertex set $V$ consists of the following locations: $\\{\\text{LaunchPad (LP)}, \\text{Tunnel1 (T1)}, \\text{Tunnel2 (T2)}, \\text{Tunnel3 (T3)}, \\text{StationA (SA)}, \\text{StationB (SB)}, \\text{StationC (SC)}, \\text{CalibEdge (CE)}\\}$.\n2.  **Edge Definitions and Costs**: Transitions between vertices are directed and incur costs in time ($t$), events ($e$), and water ($w$). Every directed edge $(u, v)$ has a uniform time cost $\\Delta t = 1$ and event cost $\\Delta e = 1$. Water consumption $\\Delta w$ for each transition is defined as follows:\n    *   $(LP, T1): 2L$\n    *   $(LP, T2): 3L$\n    *   $(T1, SA): 1L$\n    *   $(SA, T3): 1L$\n    *   $(T3, T2): 0L$\n    *   $(T2, SB): 1L$\n    *   $(T2, CE): 2L$\n    *   $(CE, SC): 1L$\n    *   $(SC, T1): 2L$\n\n**Operational Constraints**\n*   **Initial State**: At $t=0$, the agent is at $LP$ with $w = 16L$ and $e = 0$.\n*   **Global Limits**: The mission must terminate such that total elapsed time $T \\le 10$ minutes and total accumulated events $E \\le 18$. The water level $w$ must satisfy $0 \\le w \\le 16$ at all times.\n*   **Sampling Operations**: \n    *   Sampling at a station $S_i \\in \\{SA, SB, SC\\}$ requires $\\Delta t = 1$ and $\\Delta e = 1$.\n    *   Each sampling operation yields a resource recovery of $+1L$ water.\n    *   Station $SA$ and $SB$ must be sampled exactly once.\n    *   Sampling at $SA$ must occur at $t \\le 6$.\n    *   **Conditional Constraint**: $SC$ must be sampled if and only if the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed by $t \\le 8$.\n    *   **Protocol Constraint**: Consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex are prohibited.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol**: At vertex $CE$, the agent may perform a \"Refill\" action. This action requires $\\Delta t = 2$ (consecutive) and $\\Delta e = 2$, resulting in a resource gain of $+3L$ water. This action is restricted to a single occurrence per mission.\n\n**Objective Function**\nLet $N$ be the total number of unique stations sampled. Let $T_{mandatory}$ be the time at which the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed.\n1.  Maximize $N$.\n2.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. \n\nAs we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time. Finally, keep in mind that the drone is limited to a maximum of 20 total stops throughout the mission, a count that includes every minute spent traveling, scanning, or idling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}]}

You may not mix different subjects in the same room on the same day.\n*   **Daily Diversity:** Every day of the conference must include at least one session from each of the four disciplines.\n*   **Fixed Milestones:** \n    *   The conference must open (Day 1, Morning) with an AI session.\n    *   The conference must conclude (Day 3, Evening) with a Linguistics session.\n\n**Optimization Goal**\nYour objective is to populate the schedule with the twelve required sessions while maximizing the use of available halls across all time blocks. You must minimize vacant slots without violating any of the physical or logical boundaries established above.

Consider a set of six distinct academic seminars, denoted as $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6\\}$. Each seminar must be assigned a unique spatio-temporal coordinate $(t, r)$, where $t$ represents a discrete time slot and $r$ represents a specific venue.\n\n**Given Sets:**\n*   **Temporal Domain ($T$):** $\\{t_{morning}, t_{midday}, t_{afternoon}\\}$\n*   **Spatial Domain ($R$):** $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$\n\n**Objective:**\nDefine a mapping $f: S \\to T \\times R$ such that all seminars are scheduled subject to the following logical and environmental constraints:\n\n1.  **Injective Mapping (Resource Conflict):** No two distinct seminars may occupy the same room during the same time slot. Formally, for any $s_i, s_j \\in S$, if $s_i \\neq s_j$, then $f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$.\n2.  **Domain Restriction (Spatial-Temporal Exclusion):** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the final temporal period $t_{afternoon}$. For any $s_i \\in S$, if $f(s_i) = (t, r)$, then $(t, r) \\neq (t_{afternoon}, r_3)$.\n3.  **Unary Spatial Constraint:** Seminar $s_1$ must be allocated to room $r_1$, regardless of the temporal assignment. Formally, let $f(s_1) = (t, r)$; it must hold that $r = r_1$.\n4.  **Binary Temporal Constraint (Mutual Exclusion):** Seminars $s_2$ and $s_3$ are subject to a temporal disjointness constraint. If $f(s_2) = (t_a, r_b)$ and $f(s_3) = (t_c, r_d)$, then $t_a \\neq t_c$.\n\n**Task:**\n1.  Represent this problem by defining the variables, domains, and the explicit set of constraints.\n2.  Determine if a feasible solution exists under the provided constraints. \n3.

While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.\n\nNavigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover\u2019s limited six-unit battery.

The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation. Similarly, Fork2 provides a path to OutpostY as well as an alternate route to the RelayStation.\n\nThere is a specific incentive for efficiency regarding the optional RelayStation visit. The diagnostic reward offered there is only granted if the rover manages to complete both mandatory inspections at OutpostX and OutpostY while still having more than two units of battery power remaining in its reserves.

Each seminar $s \\in S$ is categorized into one of four disjoint fields $F = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology (B), Mathematics (M), Chemistry (C)}\\}$. The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$). Each day is partitioned into four sequential segments: morning ($t_1$), late morning ($t_2$), early afternoon ($t_3$), and late afternoon ($t_4$).\n*   **Spatial Domain:** There are five distinct venues available ($R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$).\n*   **Capacity:** Each room may host at most one seminar per time segment.\n\n**2. Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4. Global Optimization Objectives**\nThe resulting schedule must satisfy the following meta-conditions:\n*   **Gap Minimization:** The schedule should minimize idle time segments between the first and last seminar of each day.\n*   **Field Diversity:** Within any single time segment $t$, the schedule must maximize the variety of fields represented across different rooms.\n*   **Concurrency Limits:** At any time $t$, the total number of concurrent seminars from the set $\\{B, C\\}$ must not exceed two.\n\n**Assignment**\nFormulate this problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAs our autonomous rover prepares to navigate the subterranean tunnel network of the Mars base, we need to carefully map out its trajectory from the LaunchPad. The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water.

It departs from the Deployment Hub with a pressurized reservoir containing 16 units of thermal fluid, which is consumed during navigation and drilling. The probe must conclude its mission within a 10-minute operational window.\n\n**Navigation and Resource Costs:**\nThe cavern is structured as a network of sectors and waypoints. Fluid consumption varies based on the thermal intensity of the path:\n*   **From Deployment Hub:** The probe can enter either Sector-Alpha (2 units) or Sector-Beta (3 units).\n*   **Sector-Alpha:** Leads to Waypoint-A (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-A:** Following data retrieval, the probe can move through a bypass (1 unit) to reach Sector-Beta.\n*   **Sector-Beta:** This hub branches to either Waypoint-B (1 unit) or the Calibration-Sump (2 units).\n*   **Calibration-Sump:** This location leads to Waypoint-C (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-C:** Offers a return path to Sector-Alpha (2 units).\n\n**Data Collection Protocols:**\n*   **Mandatory Sites:** The probe is required to secure one data sample from Waypoint-A and one from Waypoint-B. \n*   **Waypoint-A Deadline:** Due to atmospheric instability, the sample at Waypoint-A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n*   **Waypoint-C (Conditional):** Retrieval at Waypoint-C is required if, and only if, the primary samples (A and B) are both secured within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n*   **Extraction Mechanics:** Each sampling operation takes 1 minute to complete. During this time, the probe\u2019s recycling system recovers 1 unit of thermal fluid from the environment. To prevent sensor fouling, the probe cannot perform two extraction operations consecutively at the same waypoint.\n\n**Maintenance and Limitations:**\n*   **The Calibration-Sump:** This site contains a unique recharge port. If the probe remains stationary here for 2 consecutive minutes, it replenishes 3 units of thermal fluid. This recharge can be performed only once before the port seals.\n*   **Mobility:** Every relocation between any two connected nodes takes exactly 1 minute. The probe must follow the established directional flow of the network.\n*   **Action Cap:** To prevent mechanical fatigue, the probe is limited to a maximum of 18 total discrete actions (moves, extractions, or recharges).\n\n**Mission Optimization:**\nThe primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples retrieved. Should different navigational paths yield the same number of samples, the mission profile that completes the mandatory extractions (Waypoint-A and Waypoint-B) in the shortest elapsed time will be selected as the optimal route."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes launchpad tunnel1 tunnel2 stationa stationb tunnel3 calibedge stationc"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges  water costs l"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: start at launchpad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement 1\u202fmin per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: tank capacity 16\u202fl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: mandatory samples stationa stationb exactly once each"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: sampling 1\u202fmin 1\u202fl per sample"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: refill at calibedge 2 min \u2192 3l at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationa must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationc sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: event limit \u2264 18 events moves  samples  refill"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: primary maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: secondary minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}]}

The agent must execute a sampling mission subject to strict volumetric, temporal, and operational constraints.\n\n**1. Network Topology and Edge Weights:**\nThe vertex set is defined as $V = \\{v_{LP}, v_A, v_B, v_C, v_{CE}\\}$, representing the LaunchPad, Station A, Station B, Station C, and a Calibration Shaft, respectively. The directed edges $E$ and their associated volumetric costs $w(e)$ (reduction in tank capacity) are defined as follows:\n*   $e_1: (v_{LP}, v_A), w(e_1) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_2: (v_{LP}, v_B), w(e_2) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_3: (v_A, v_B), w(e_3) = 1\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_4: (v_{LP}, v_{CE}), w(e_4) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_5: (v_{CE}, v_C), w(e_5) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_6: (v_C, v_A), w(e_6) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Agent Capabilities:**\n*   **Time ($t$):** The mission begins at $t=0$. Every traversal of an edge $e \\in E$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute.\n*   **Tank Capacity ($C$):** The agent possesses an internal reservoir with a maximum capacity $C_{max} = 16\\,\\text{L}$. The initial state is $C_0 = 16\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Sampling:** Collecting a specimen at any station $v \\in \\{v_A, v_B, v_C\\}$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute and reduces $C$ by $1\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Refilling:** At $v_{CE}$, the agent may perform a one-time refill operation, increasing $C$ by $3\\,\\text{L}$ (not to exceed $C_{max}$). This operation requires $\\Delta t = 2$ consecutive minutes of idling.\n*   **Event Counter ($k$):** The total sequence of discrete actions (traversals, samplings, and refills) is limited to $k \\le 18$.\n\n**3. Mission Constraints:**\nThe agent\u2019s path must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   **Mandatory Samples:** The agent must successfully perform at least one sampling operation at $v_A$ and $v_B$.\n*   **Temporal Deadlines:** The first sampling operation at $v_A$ must be completed such that $t \\le 6$.\n*   **Optional Sampling:** A sampling operation at $v_C$ is permissible **if and only if** the first instances of sampling at both $v_A$ and $v_B$ are completed within the interval $t \\in [0, 8]$.\n*   **Resource Integrity:** At no point in the mission may $C < 0$.\n*   **Cross-Contamination Protocol:** The agent is prohibited from performing two consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex.\n\n**4. Optimization Objectives:**\nFormulate a path $\\mathcal{P}$ that satisfies all constraints while optimizing the following criteria in lexicographical order:\n1.  **Maximize** the total number of samples collected $N_{total}$.\n2.  **Minimize** the completion time $t_{final}$ of the last mandatory sample ($v_A$ or $v_B$).\n\n**Required:**\na) Provide the state-space representation of the AUV.\nb) Determine if an optimal path exists that includes Station C.

The selection must satisfy a series of thermal, electrical, and budgetary constraints.\n\n**Component Catalog:**\nEach component $i$ is defined by a tuple $(W_i, P_i)$, where $W_i$ denotes wattage (consumption for CPUs/GPUs; capacity for PSUs) and $P_i$ denotes unit cost in USD.\n\n1.  **CPUs ($\\mathcal{C}$):** \n    *   BoltX: (85W, \\$400)\n    *   HydraPro: (125W, \\$550)\n    *   LiteCore: (60W, \\$350)\n2.  **GPUs ($\\mathcal{G}$):** \n    *   StormZ: (180W, \\$800)\n    *   Nebula9: (150W, \\$650)\n    *   VegaLite: (95W, \\$500)\n3.  **PSUs ($\\mathcal{P}$):** \n    *   PowerMax750: (750W, \\$200)\n    *   Eco600: (600W, \\$150)\n    *   Titan900: (900W, \\$250)\n\n**Feasibility Constraints:**\nA configuration $S = \\{c, g, p\\}$ (where $c \\in \\mathcal{C}, g \\in \\mathcal{G}, p \\in \\mathcal{P}$) is considered valid if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1.  **Electrical Margin Constraint:** The aggregate power draw of the processing units must maintain a safety buffer of at least 100W relative to the PSU capacity.\n    $$W_c + W_g \\le W_p - 100$$\n\n2.  **Cost-Wattage Correlation:** To ensure proportional investment, the component with the highest wattage in the configuration must also be the component with the highest price.\n    $$\\text{argmax}_{x \\in S} (W_x) = \\text{argmax}_{x \\in S} (P_x)$$\n    *(Note: If multiple components share the maximum value, the condition must hold for at least one such mapping.)*\n\n3.  **Component Compatibility:** Certain hardware pairings are restricted due to technical externalities:\n    *   $\\{HydraPro, VegaLite\\}$ is an impermissible set.\n    *   $\\{Eco600, StormZ\\}$ is an impermissible set.\n\n4.  **Minimal Expenditure Restriction:** The configuration $S$ cannot simultaneously consist of the least expensive element from each of the three categories.\n    $$S \\neq \\{LiteCore, VegaLite, Eco600\\}$$\n\n5.  **Price Dispersion Limit:** To maintain balanced component quality, the absolute difference in price between any two selected components must not exceed \\$400.\n    $$\\forall x, y \\in S: |P_x - P_y| \\le 400$$\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid configurations $S = \\{c, g, p\\}$ that satisfy the above constraints.

For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100.

Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible.

For any $s_i, s_j \\in \\mathcal{S}$, if $i \\neq j$, then $f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$.\n2.  **Domain-Specific Temporal Restriction (AI):** For all $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ where $T_s = \\text{AI}$, the assigned time slot $p$ must satisfy $p \\in \\{p_1, p_2\\}$. (Seminars in AI are excluded from afternoon slots).\n3.  **Spatial Dispersion (Biology):** Let $\\mathcal{S}_{Bio} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ be the subset of seminars focused on Biology. The set of rooms assigned to $\\mathcal{S}_{Bio}$ must have a cardinality $|\\{r \\mid \\exists s \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Bio}, f(s) = (d, p, r)\\}| \\geq 2$.\n4.  **Venue Exclusion:** The coordinate $(d, p_2, 4)$ is unavailable for all $d \\in \\mathcal{D}$.

Each session $s_i$ is characterized by an attribute $A$, representing its technical domain, such that $A(s_i) \\in \\{\\text{Networking}, \\text{Security}\\}$.\n\n**Available Resources:**\nThe allocation must occur within a discrete spatio-temporal domain defined by:\n1.  A set of temporal slots $T = \\{t_{morning}, t_{afternoon}\\}$.\n2.  A set of spatial venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n\n**Objective:**\nDefine a schedule as a mapping $f: S \\to T \\times R$ that assigns each session to a unique coordinate in the resource grid, subject to the following system of constraints:\n\n**1. Resource Exclusivity (Injectivity Constraint):**\nThe mapping $f$ must be injective. Specifically, for any two distinct sessions $s_i, s_j \\in S$:\n$$s_i \\neq s_j \\implies f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$$\nThis ensures that no two sessions occupy the same room during the same time slot. Given $|S| = |T \\times R|$, the mapping must be bijective.\n\n**2. Domain-Specific Temporal Constraints:**\nLet $proj_T$ be the projection of the schedule onto the temporal set $T$. For any session $s_i \\in S$:\n$$\\text{If } A(s_i) = \\text{Security}, \\text{ then } proj_T(f(s_i)) = t_{afternoon}$$\n\n**3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe have a significant puzzle to solve regarding the upcoming two-day research symposium. We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields. If we can balance these technical quirks and room capacities, we\u2019ll have a seamless program that serves both our presenters and our guests."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: seminars are on ai bio math or chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Bio\"; \"Math\"; \"Chem\").\n1{topicOf(S, T): topic(T)}1 :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 4 time slots per day over two days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1; 2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the time slots are morining late morning early afternoon late afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\"; \"late morning\"; \"early afternoon\"; \"late afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 5 rooms are used"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: every seminar must be delivered"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{delivered(S, R, T, D) : room(R), timeslot(T), day(D)} :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only one sesion in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, T, D), delivered(S2, R, T, D), S1 != S2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: rooms can only be used twice in a day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{delivered(S, R, T, D) : seminar(S), timeslot(T)}2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: rooms can not be used twice in a row"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "follows(\"morning\",\"late morning\";\"late morning\",\n\"early afternoon\";\"early afternoon\", \"late afternoon\").\n:- delivered(_, R, T1, _), delivered(_, R, T2, _), follows(T1, T2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: room 3 is not available in the afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(_, R, T, _), R = 3, T = \"early afternoon\"; T = \"late afternoon\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: room 5 doesnt have a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(R) :- room(R), R = 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ai and math require a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), -projector(R).\n:- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"Math\"), -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ai can only be in the morning or late morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, _, T, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), T != \"morning\", T != \"late morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bio sessions must be spread across both days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasBio(D) :- delivered(S, _, _, D), topicOf(S, \"Bio\").\n:- day(D), not hasBio(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bio sessions can not happen at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no two chem sessions can happen in the same room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, _), delivered(S2, R, _, _), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the first and last sessions must be math"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "firstSession(\"morning\", 1).\nlastSession(\"late afternoon\", 2).\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), firstSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}.\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), lastSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: do not waste any timeslots in rooms unless necessary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wastedSlot(R, T, D) :- not delivered(_, R, T, D), room(R), timeslot(T), day(D).\nwastedSlots(N) :- #count{R, T, D: wastedSlot(R, T, D)} = N.\n#minimize{N: wastedSlots(N)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: at most 2 bio and chem sessions may overlap"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "overlap(T, D) :- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\").\n{ overlap(T, D) : timeslot(T), day(D) }2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each timeslot should have seminars from as many topics as possible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(To, T, D) :- delivered(S, _, T, D), topicOf(S, To).\ntopicsPerSlot(N, T, D) :- #count{To: hasTopic(To, T, D)} = N, timeslot(T), day(D).\n#maximize{N: topicsPerSlot(N, T, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bio and chem may not happen in the same room on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, D), delivered(S2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}]}

An assignment is defined as a mapping of a workshop to a unique triplet $(d, t, r) \\in D \\times T \\times R$.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n1.  **Exclusivity and Capacity Constraints:**\n    *   **Unit Occupancy:** For any given $(d, t, r)$, at most one workshop $w \\in W$ may be scheduled.\n    *   **Daily Room Bound:** For each room $r \\in R$ on any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled workshops $n_{d,r}$ must satisfy $1 \\le n_{d,r} \\le 2$. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one time slot per day.\n    *   **Venue Availability:** Room $r_2$ is restricted such that no workshops may be scheduled during $t_3$ on either $d_1$ or $d_2$.\n\n2.  **Subject-Specific Temporal and Spatial Constraints:**\n    *   **AI Temporal Restriction:** Workshops where $s = \\text{AI}$ must be scheduled exclusively during the morning slot $t_1$.\n    *   **Mathematics Non-Concurrency:** Let $W_M \\subset W$ be the subset of workshops where $s = \\text{M}$. For any $w_i, w_j \\in W_M$ ($i \\neq j$), the assigned time slots $(d_i, t_i)$ and $(d_j, t_j)$ must be distinct. No two Mathematics workshops may occur simultaneously, regardless of room assignment.\n    *   **Subject Segregation:** For any day $d \\in D$ and room $r \\in R$, the room may not host both a workshop of subject AI and a workshop of subject B. If an AI workshop is assigned to $(d, r, t_i)$, then no Biology workshop may be assigned to $(d, r, t_j)$ for any $t_j \\in T$, and vice versa.\n\n3.  **Distributional Requirements:**\n    *   **Daily Subject Coverage:** For each day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each subject category $s \\in S$. \n\n**Objective:**\nIdentify a feasible schedule that satisfies all aforementioned logical and physical constraints. In the event of multiple feasible solutions, the optimal schedule is defined as the one that maximizes the utilization of available spatio-temporal slots (minimizing the cardinality of the set of unused valid room-time pairs).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Define the decision variables for the scheduling problem.\n2.  Provide a formal mapping of the eight workshops to the coordinates $(d, t, r)$.\n3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe have a significant puzzle to solve regarding the upcoming two-day research symposium. We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields. If we can balance these technical quirks and room capacities, we\u2019ll have a seamless program that serves both our presenters and our guests."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI and Math require a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), -projector(R).\n:- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"Math\"), -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI can only be in the morning or late morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, _, T, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), T != \"morning\", T != \"late morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 5 doesn't have a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(R) :- room(R), R = 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most 2 Bio and Chem Sessions may overlap"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "overlap(T, D) :- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\").\n{ overlap(T, D) : timeslot(T), day(D) }2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The time slots are morining, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\"; \"late morning\"; \"early afternoon\"; \"late afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Every seminar must be delivered"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{delivered(S, R, T, D) : room(R), timeslot(T), day(D)} :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each timeslot should have seminars from as many topics as possible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(To, T, D) :- delivered(S, _, T, D), topicOf(S, To).\ntopicsPerSlot(N, T, D) :- #count{To: hasTopic(To, T, D)} = N, timeslot(T), day(D).\n#maximize{N: topicsPerSlot(N, T, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms can only be used twice in a day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{delivered(S, R, T, D) : seminar(S), timeslot(T)}2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Do not waste any timeslots in rooms unless necessary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wastedSlot(R, T, D) :- not delivered(_, R, T, D), room(R), timeslot(T), day(D).\nwastedSlots(N) :- #count{R, T, D: wastedSlot(R, T, D)} = N.\n#minimize{N: wastedSlots(N)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two Chem sessions can happen in the same room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, _), delivered(S2, R, _, _), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Chem\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms can not be used twice in a row"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "follows(\"morning\",\"late morning\";\"late morning\",\n\"early afternoon\";\"early afternoon\", \"late afternoon\").\n:- delivered(_, R, T1, _), delivered(_, R, T2, _), follows(T1, T2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio and Chem may not happen in the same room on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, _, D), delivered(S2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(S1, \"Chem\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 4 time slots per day over two days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1; 2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 3 is not available in the afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(_, R, T, _), R = 3, T = \"early afternoon\"; T = \"late afternoon\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio sessions must be spread across both days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasBio(D) :- delivered(S, _, _, D), topicOf(S, \"Bio\").\n:- day(D), not hasBio(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The first and last sessions must be Math"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "firstSession(\"morning\", 1).\nlastSession(\"late afternoon\", 2).\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), firstSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}.\n1{delivered(S, R, T, D): room(R), lastSession(T, D), topicOf(S, \"Math\")}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars are on AI, Bio, Math, or Chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Bio\"; \"Math\"; \"Chem\").\n1{topicOf(S, T): topic(T)}1 :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 5 Rooms are used"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one sesion in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, R, T, D), delivered(S2, R, T, D), S1 != S2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio sessions can not happen at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S1, _, T, D), delivered(S2, _, T, D), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(S2, \"Bio\")."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Multi-Agent Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement**\nAn academic institution is organizing a two-day research symposium consisting of ten discrete seminars. Each seminar $s \\in S$ is categorized into one of four disjoint fields $F = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology (B), Mathematics (M), Chemistry (C)}\\}$. The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$). Each day is partitioned into four sequential segments: morning ($t_1$), late morning ($t_2$), early afternoon ($t_3$), and late afternoon ($t_4$).\n*   **Spatial Domain:** There are five distinct venues available ($R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$).\n*   **Capacity:** Each room may host at most one seminar per time segment.\n\n**2. Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4. Global Optimization Objectives**\nThe resulting schedule must satisfy the following meta-conditions:\n*   **Gap Minimization:** The schedule should minimize idle time segments between the first and last seminar of each day.\n*   **Field Diversity:** Within any single time segment $t$, the schedule must maximize the variety of fields represented across different rooms.\n*   **Concurrency Limits:** At any time $t$, the total number of concurrent seminars from the set $\\{B, C\\}$ must not exceed two.\n\n**Assignment**\nFormulate this problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit\nconsecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}]}

We have six workshops in total that need to be slotted into a single day, and they\u2019re divided among three main topics: Data, DevOps, and User Interface. The venue has given us three rooms to work with, and the day itself is split into three distinct time blocks\u2014the morning, midday, and afternoon sessions.\n\nAs we put this together, we have to make sure every one of those six workshops is assigned to a specific room and a specific time slot. However, the venue has a strict policy that no single room can host more than two sessions over the course of the day. Of course, this also means we can\u2019t have two different workshops occupying the same room at the same time.\n\nThe content of the workshops adds another layer of complexity to the schedule. The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.\n\nTo make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics\u2014Data, DevOps, and UI\u2014is represented at least once on the final schedule.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn automated underwater vehicle (AUV) is launched from a Surface Hub to perform a critical inspection of several submerged research stations linked by a web of one-way navigational currents. Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed. If two paths result in the same number of sweeps, the strategy that completes the mandatory sweeps (X and Y) in the shortest total time is preferred.\n*   **Sensor Safety:** To prevent equipment fatigue, the AUV is strictly forbidden from performing back-to-back sensor sweeps at the same station."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}]}

Each lecture $l_i$ is associated with a specific subject $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$, where $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Physics}\\}$. \n\nThe objective is to define a feasible assignment of these lectures into a spatio-temporal domain defined by:\n1.  A set of discrete time slots $\\mathcal{T} = \\{t_{morning}, t_{afternoon}\\}$.\n2.  A set of physical venues $\\mathcal{R} = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nLet an assignment be a function $\\sigma: \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{R}$, where each lecture is mapped to a unique (time, room) tuple. A valid schedule must satisfy the following formal conditions:\n\n**Condition I: Resource Uniqueness (Injective Mapping)**\nThe mapping $\\sigma$ must be injective with respect to the codomain $\\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{R}$. Formally, for any two distinct lectures $l_i, l_j \\in \\mathcal{L}$, $\\sigma(l_i) \\neq \\sigma(l_j)$. This precludes the simultaneous occupancy of a single room by multiple lectures.\n\n**Condition II: Subject-Based Spatial Exclusion**\nDefine a function $f: \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathcal{S}$ that maps each lecture to its respective subject. For any pair of lectures $(l_i, l_j)$, if $f(l_i) = \\text{Mathematics}$ and $f(l_j) = \\text{Physics}$, their assigned rooms must be disjoint, regardless of the temporal component. That is:\n$$\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_j))$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}$ denotes the projection of the assignment onto the set of rooms.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250.

The event is spread across two days, with each day broken down into three specific time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon. We have four rooms at our disposal for these sessions, but keep in mind that a room can only host one seminar during any single time slot.\n\nWhen you start mapping out the topics\u2014AI, Biology, and Math\u2014there are several departmental requirements we have to honor. The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.\n\nWe also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you\u2019ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nFinally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous submersible departs from its primary Launch Bay into a network of undersea corridors. These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.\n\n### Foundational Protocols\n1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.\n2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.\n3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.\n4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums.

We have six workshops in total that need to be slotted into a single day, and they\u2019re divided among three main topics: Data, DevOps, and User Interface. The venue has given us three rooms to work with, and the day itself is split into three distinct time blocks\u2014the morning, midday, and afternoon sessions.\n\nAs we put this together, we have to make sure every one of those six workshops is assigned to a specific room and a specific time slot. However, the venue has a strict policy that no single room can host more than two sessions over the course of the day. Of course, this also means we can\u2019t have two different workshops occupying the same room at the same time.\n\nThe content of the workshops adds another layer of complexity to the schedule. The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.\n\nTo make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics\u2014Data, DevOps, and UI\u2014is represented at least once on the final schedule.

It must collect samples at StationA \nand StationB, but can optionally sample at StationC if time allows. \nThe aqueducts are one\u2011way tunnels, each carrying a distinct water volume \ncost that reduces the drone\u2019s internal tank capacity (max 16\u202fL). Moving \nthrough any tunnel takes exactly 1\u202fminute, and collecting a sample at a \nstation requires 1\u202fminute and fills 1\u202fL.\nFrom LaunchPad, two connectors diverge: Tunnel1 (cost 2\u202fL) and Tunnel2 \n(cost 3\u202fL).

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor.

The catch is that we have to be very careful about how we pair them up to ensure the system actually works. \n\nFor instance, the Alpha speaker is a bit finicky and will only work if we use AmpX to power it. On the digital side, we have to remember that AmpY and Streamer1 are completely incompatible with each other, so those two can never be used in the same configuration. To make matters even more complicated, the Streamer2 is designed with a very specific output that only functions when it's paired with the Beta speaker.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. \n\nAs we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time. Finally, keep in mind that the drone is limited to a maximum of 20 total stops throughout the mission, a count that includes every minute spent traveling, scanning, or idling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes commandcenter patha pathb towerx towery midrelay towerz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges and movement costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone starts at commandcenter at time 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 full minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone must scan towerx and towery at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerx must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerz can be scanned optionally"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the total number of location visits must not exceed 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: if the drone visits midrelay then it must be at towerz in the next timestep"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: as a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at midrelay"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}

The event is hosted in a venue with four rooms, and each day is structured into three distinct sessions consisting of a morning, a midday, and an evening slot. Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.\n\nAs we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly. No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.\n\nThematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.\n\nTo keep the daily schedule organized, we\u2019ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won\u2019t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.\n\nOur objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn automated underwater vehicle (AUV) is launched from a Surface Hub to perform a critical inspection of several submerged research stations linked by a web of one-way navigational currents. Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed. If two paths result in the same number of sweeps, the strategy that completes the mandatory sweeps (X and Y) in the shortest total time is preferred.\n*   **Sensor Safety:** To prevent equipment fatigue, the AUV is strictly forbidden from performing back-to-back sensor sweeps at the same station."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes commandcenter patha pathb towerx towery midrelay towerz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges and movement costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone starts at commandcenter at time 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 full minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone must scan towerx and towery at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerx must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerz can be scanned optionally"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the total number of location visits must not exceed 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: if the drone visits midrelay then it must be at towerz in the next timestep"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: as a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at midrelay"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}

The primary mission objective is to conduct a thorough inspection of both OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once. While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.\n\nNavigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover\u2019s limited six-unit battery. Furthermore, once the rover arrives at a destination, it must remain stationary for a full minute to complete its scanning sequence. The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation.

Each workshop $w_i$ is associated with exactly one topic $t$ from the set of topics $T = \\{\\text{Data, DevOps, UI}\\}$. Let $\\tau: W \\to T$ be a function mapping workshops to topics. The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$. (Data workshops are prohibited from $r_3$).\n*   **Topic Concurrency Prohibition:** Workshops focusing on **Data** and **UI** are mutually exclusive in the temporal dimension. Formally, for any $w_i, w_j \\in W$:\n    $$\\text{if } \\tau(w_i) = \\text{Data and } \\tau(w_j) = \\text{UI, then } \\text{proj}_S(f(w_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_S(f(w_j)).$$\n\n**5. Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100.

Each workshop $w_i$ is associated with exactly one topic $t$ from the set of topics $T = \\{\\text{Data, DevOps, UI}\\}$. Let $\\tau: W \\to T$ be a function mapping workshops to topics. The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$. (Data workshops are prohibited from $r_3$).\n*   **Topic Concurrency Prohibition:** Workshops focusing on **Data** and **UI** are mutually exclusive in the temporal dimension. Formally, for any $w_i, w_j \\in W$:\n    $$\\text{if } \\tau(w_i) = \\text{Data and } \\tau(w_j) = \\text{UI, then } \\text{proj}_S(f(w_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_S(f(w_j)).$$\n\n**5. Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1. Formulate a feasible schedule $f(w)$ for all $w \\in W$.\n2. Prove that your proposed schedule satisfies the **Topic Concurrency Prohibition** and the **Room Capacity Constraints**.\n3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThe procurement team has adopted a new philosophy for our latest batch of data-processing workstations, moving away from raw power in favor of what they call \"proportional utility.\" As you start putting these builds together, you\u2019ll need to select exactly one component from each of the three categories available in our inventory. For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100. By following these guidelines, we should end up with a workstation that is perfectly optimized for our needs without overspending on unnecessary power."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpus  falconx corezen ecomini"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"FalconX\"; \"CoreZen\"; \"EcoMini\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs falconx 600 corezen 500 ecomini 300"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"FalconX\", 600; \"CoreZen\", 500; \"EcoMini\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: performance falconx 125 corezen 115 ecomini 90"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"FalconX\", 125; \"CoreZen\", 115; \"EcoMini\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpus  titanz midlinegt pixie"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "gpu(\"TitanZ\"; \"MidlineGT\"; \"Pixie\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs titanz 700 midlinegt 500 pixie 400"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"TitanZ\", 700; \"MidlineGT\", 500; \"Pixie\", 400)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: performance titanz 135 midlinegt 100 pixie 95"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"TitanZ\", 135; \"MidlineGT\", 100; \"Pixie\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: drives  flashnova terabox budgetdisk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "drive(\"FlashNova\"; \"Terabox\"; \"BudgetDisk\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs flashnova 250 terabox 300 budgetdisk 150"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"FlashNova\", 250; \"Terabox\", 300; \"BudgetDisk\", 150)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: performance flashnova 110 terabox 100 budgetdisk 60"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"FlashNova\", 110; \"Terabox\", 100; \"BudgetDisk\", 60)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select one cpu one gpu and one drive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_drive(D) : drive(D) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: midperformance component must be the cheapest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_drive(X).\nmax_perf(P) :- P = #max {V : perf(X, V), selected(X)}.\nmin_perf(P) :- P = #min {V : perf(X, V), selected(X)}.\nmid_component(X) :- selected(X), perf(X, P), not min_perf(P), not max_perf(P).\ncheapest(X) :- cost(X, C), selected(X), C = #min {C1 : cost(X1, C1), selected(X1)}.\n:- mid_component(X1), cheapest(X2), X1 != X2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: if cpu  500 can not use pixie gpu"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), cost(C, VC), VC > 500, selected_gpu(\"Pixie\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: max  min performance \u2264 50"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- max_perf(H), min_perf(L),  H > L + 50."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: if drive is flashnova gpu performance \u2265 100"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_drive(\"FlashNova\"), selected_gpu(G), perf(G, P), P < 100."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: exactly two selected components must cost  300"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N != 2, N = #count {X : selected(X), cost(X, V), V > 300}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu performance must be between cpu and drive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- mid_component(X), not gpu(X)."}]}

The agent must execute a sequence of operations\u2014comprising movement, resource acquisition, and site sampling\u2014subject to strict temporal, resource, and logical constraints.\n\n**System Specifications**\n1.  **Graph Topology**: The vertex set $V$ consists of the following locations: $\\{\\text{LaunchPad (LP)}, \\text{Tunnel1 (T1)}, \\text{Tunnel2 (T2)}, \\text{Tunnel3 (T3)}, \\text{StationA (SA)}, \\text{StationB (SB)}, \\text{StationC (SC)}, \\text{CalibEdge (CE)}\\}$.\n2.  **Edge Definitions and Costs**: Transitions between vertices are directed and incur costs in time ($t$), events ($e$), and water ($w$). Every directed edge $(u, v)$ has a uniform time cost $\\Delta t = 1$ and event cost $\\Delta e = 1$. Water consumption $\\Delta w$ for each transition is defined as follows:\n    *   $(LP, T1): 2L$\n    *   $(LP, T2): 3L$\n    *   $(T1, SA): 1L$\n    *   $(SA, T3): 1L$\n    *   $(T3, T2): 0L$\n    *   $(T2, SB): 1L$\n    *   $(T2, CE): 2L$\n    *   $(CE, SC): 1L$\n    *   $(SC, T1): 2L$\n\n**Operational Constraints**\n*   **Initial State**: At $t=0$, the agent is at $LP$ with $w = 16L$ and $e = 0$.\n*   **Global Limits**: The mission must terminate such that total elapsed time $T \\le 10$ minutes and total accumulated events $E \\le 18$. The water level $w$ must satisfy $0 \\le w \\le 16$ at all times.\n*   **Sampling Operations**: \n    *   Sampling at a station $S_i \\in \\{SA, SB, SC\\}$ requires $\\Delta t = 1$ and $\\Delta e = 1$.\n    *   Each sampling operation yields a resource recovery of $+1L$ water.\n    *   Station $SA$ and $SB$ must be sampled exactly once.\n    *   Sampling at $SA$ must occur at $t \\le 6$.\n    *   **Conditional Constraint**: $SC$ must be sampled if and only if the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed by $t \\le 8$.\n    *   **Protocol Constraint**: Consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex are prohibited.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol**: At vertex $CE$, the agent may perform a \"Refill\" action. This action requires $\\Delta t = 2$ (consecutive) and $\\Delta e = 2$, resulting in a resource gain of $+3L$ water. This action is restricted to a single occurrence per mission.\n\n**Objective Function**\nLet $N$ be the total number of unique stations sampled. Let $T_{mandatory}$ be the time at which the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed.\n1.  Maximize $N$.\n2.  Subject to the maximum of $N$, minimize $T_{mandatory}$.\n\n**Task**\nFormulate the optimal state-transition sequence that satisfies all aforementioned conditions.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Resource Allocation and Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement**\nA technical symposium requires the scheduling of a set of ten presentations, denoted by $P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{10}\\}$. Each presentation $p_i$ is associated with exactly one domain $k$ from the set $K = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (C), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR)}\\}$. \n\nThe event occurs over a temporal horizon of four days, $D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with each day partitioned into four discrete, sequential sessions: $S = \\{\\text{early morning}, \\text{late morning}, \\text{early afternoon}, \\text{late afternoon}\\}$. Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4. Boundary Conditions\n*   **Initialization:** The session $(d=1, s=\\text{early morning})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{AI\\}$ domain.\n*   **Termination:** The session $(d=4, s=\\text{early afternoon})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{VR\\}$ domain.\n\n### 5. Optimization Objectives\nIn the event that multiple feasible schedules exist, the optimal schedule shall be determined by the following lexicographical preference order:\n1.  **Maximize Spatial Parallelism:** Maximize the number of rooms utilized during each active session $(d, s)$.\n2.  **Maximize Efficiency:** Minimize the total number of idle (unassigned) room-time slots across the global schedule, subject to the preservation of all primary constraints.\n\n**Task:**\nFormalize the above as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Provide a valid assignment of $P$ to the domain $D \\times S \\times R$ that satisfies all conditions, or prove that no such assignment exists given the strictness of the non-contiguity and diversity constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 presentations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(P, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each presentation must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : room(R), slot(Sl), day(D) } :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one presentation per room\u2011time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, Sl, D), scheduled(P2, R, Sl, D), P1 != P2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most three times per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : presentation(P), slot(Sl) } 3 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, R, Sl1, D), scheduled(_, R, Sl2, D), Sl1 = Sl2 - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"AI\", -projector(R).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"Cloud\", -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR cannot be in room 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, 1, _, _), topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(D) :- scheduled(P, _, _, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { D : hasIoT(D) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, _, D), scheduled(P2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(P1, \"VR\"), topicOf(P2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- day(D), slot(S), #count { P : cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(P, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each day must have at least one presentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), not scheduled(_, _, _, D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(T, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, T).\n:- slot(Sl), day(D), #count { T : hasTopic(T, Sl, D) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, Sl, D) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl, D).\nroomsUsed(N, Sl, D) :- N = #count { R : used(R, Sl, D) }, slot(Sl), day(D).\n#maximize { N@2 : roomsUsed(N, Sl, D) }.\nidle(R, Sl, D) :- room(R), slot(Sl), day(D), not used(R, Sl, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, Sl, D: idle(R, Sl, D) }.\n#minimize { N@1: num_idle(N) }."}]}

To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.\n\n### Foundational Protocols\n1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.\n2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.\n3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.\n4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums. At least two different topics must be represented in any slot where lectures are occurring.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** When determining the ideal layout among multiple valid configurations:\n    1.

Arterial Path 1 (2-unit cost) reaches Site Alpha (1-unit access cost). Arterial Path 2 (3-unit cost) leads toward Site Beta or a Calibration Shaft.\n*   **From Site Alpha:** The probe can take Connector 3 (1-unit cost) to merge into Arterial Path 2.\n*   **From Arterial Path 2:** The probe may proceed to Site Beta (1-unit access cost) or enter the Calibration Shaft (2-unit access cost).\n*   **From Calibration Shaft:** Entry is permitted into Site Gamma (1-unit access cost).\n*   **From Site Gamma:** A return flow allows the probe to re-enter Arterial Path 1 at a cost of 2 units.\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n1.  **Temporal & Volumetric Limits:** The probe begins at T-0 with 16 units.

While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds.

Context and System Definition**\nConsider an autonomous agent $\\mathcal{A}$ (a maintenance rover) operating within a discrete topological space represented by an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The vertex set $V$ represents physical locations, and the edge set $E$ represents traversable paths of unit distance.\n\nThe vertex set is defined as:\n$V = \\{v_{BC}, v_{F1}, v_{F2}, v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$\nwhere:\n*   $v_{BC}$: BaseCamp (Initial State)\n*   $v_{F1}, v_{F2}$: Intermediate Junctions (Fork1, Fork2)\n*   $v_{OX}, v_{OY}$: Mandatory Inspection Targets (OutpostX, OutpostY)\n*   $v_{RS}$: Optional Diagnostic Node (RelayStation)\n\nThe adjacency relations are defined by the set $E$:\n$E = \\{(v_{BC}, v_{F1}), (v_{BC}, v_{F2}), (v_{F1}, v_{OX}), (v_{F1}, v_{RS}), (v_{F2}, v_{OY}), (v_{F2}, v_{RS})\\}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Constraints**\nThe agent is subject to two primary resource constraints: Temporal ($T$) and Energetic ($B$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** At $t=0$, the agent is positioned at $v_{BC}$ with an initial battery capacity $B_0 = 6$ units and elapsed time $T_0 = 0$ minutes.\n*   **Temporal Costs:** \n    *   Movement between any two adjacent vertices $v_i, v_j \\in V$ incurs a cost $\\Delta T_{move} = 1$ minute.\n    *   The inspection process at any node $v \\in \\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$ requires a stationary duration of $\\Delta T_{inspect} = 1$ minute.\n*   **Energy Costs:** Each movement action consumes $\\Delta B = 1$ unit of battery. Stationary inspections do not deplete battery resources.\n*   **Global Bounds:** The total elapsed time must satisfy $T_{final} \\le 10$. The battery level must satisfy $B_t \\ge 0$ for all $t$.\n\n**3. Objectives and Task Requirements**\nThe agent must execute a path $P$ that satisfies the following conditions:\n1.  **Mandatory Coverage:** The set of visited and inspected nodes must include $\\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}\\}$. Each mandatory node must be inspected exactly once.\n2.  **Optional Reward Condition:** The agent may optionally inspect $v_{RS}$. Let $t_{req}$ be the timestamp at which the second of the two mandatory inspections ($v_{OX}, v_{OY}$) is completed. A diagnostic reward is granted for inspecting $v_{RS}$ if and only if $B_{t_{req}} > 2$.\n\n**4. Problem Statement**\nFormalize the agent's movement as a sequence of states. Determine the feasibility of completing all mandatory inspections while maximizing the diagnostic reward. \n\n**Tasks:**\n*   (a) Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree representing the possible trajectories of the rover.\n*   (b) Identify if there exists a valid path $P$ such that $v_{RS}$ is inspected and the diagnostic reward condition ($B_{t_{req}} > 2$) is satisfied within the global temporal bound $T \\le 10$.\n*   (c) If such a path exists, provide the sequence of vertices and actions (Move/Inspect).

We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor.

Context and System Definition**\nConsider an autonomous agent $\\mathcal{A}$ (a maintenance rover) operating within a discrete topological space represented by an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The vertex set $V$ represents physical locations, and the edge set $E$ represents traversable paths of unit distance.\n\nThe vertex set is defined as:\n$V = \\{v_{BC}, v_{F1}, v_{F2}, v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$\nwhere:\n*   $v_{BC}$: BaseCamp (Initial State)\n*   $v_{F1}, v_{F2}$: Intermediate Junctions (Fork1, Fork2)\n*   $v_{OX}, v_{OY}$: Mandatory Inspection Targets (OutpostX, OutpostY)\n*   $v_{RS}$: Optional Diagnostic Node (RelayStation)\n\nThe adjacency relations are defined by the set $E$:\n$E = \\{(v_{BC}, v_{F1}), (v_{BC}, v_{F2}), (v_{F1}, v_{OX}), (v_{F1}, v_{RS}), (v_{F2}, v_{OY}), (v_{F2}, v_{RS})\\}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Constraints**\nThe agent is subject to two primary resource constraints: Temporal ($T$) and Energetic ($B$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** At $t=0$, the agent is positioned at $v_{BC}$ with an initial battery capacity $B_0 = 6$ units and elapsed time $T_0 = 0$ minutes.\n*   **Temporal Costs:** \n    *   Movement between any two adjacent vertices $v_i, v_j \\in V$ incurs a cost $\\Delta T_{move} = 1$ minute.\n    *   The inspection process at any node $v \\in \\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$ requires a stationary duration of $\\Delta T_{inspect} = 1$ minute.\n*   **Energy Costs:** Each movement action consumes $\\Delta B = 1$ unit of battery. Stationary inspections do not deplete battery resources.\n*   **Global Bounds:** The total elapsed time must satisfy $T_{final} \\le 10$. The battery level must satisfy $B_t \\ge 0$ for all $t$.\n\n**3. Objectives and Task Requirements**\nThe agent must execute a path $P$ that satisfies the following conditions:\n1.  **Mandatory Coverage:** The set of visited and inspected nodes must include $\\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}\\}$. Each mandatory node must be inspected exactly once.\n2.  **Optional Reward Condition:** The agent may optionally inspect $v_{RS}$. Let $t_{req}$ be the timestamp at which the second of the two mandatory inspections ($v_{OX}, v_{OY}$) is completed. A diagnostic reward is granted for inspecting $v_{RS}$ if and only if $B_{t_{req}} > 2$.\n\n**4. Problem Statement**\nFormalize the agent's movement as a sequence of states. Determine the feasibility of completing all mandatory inspections while maximizing the diagnostic reward. \n\n**Tasks:**\n*   (a) Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree representing the possible trajectories of the rover.\n*   (b) Identify if there exists a valid path $P$ such that $v_{RS}$ is inspected and the diagnostic reward condition ($B_{t_{req}} > 2$) is satisfied within the global temporal bound $T \\le 10$.\n*   (c) If such a path exists, provide the sequence of vertices and actions (Move/Inspect).

Biology seminars, by contrast, must be sprinkled\nacross the two days \u2014 never exclusively in one \u2014 and you cannot have two bio talks\ntaking place simultaneously. Chemistry talks, on the other hand, are social\nin time but solitary in space: no two of them may ever occupy the same\nroom. Additionally, you can\u2019t mix a Bio session with a Chem\nsession under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.\nThere\u2019s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close\nwith mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both\nmathematics events. Beyond that, you\u2019ll want to avoid empty slots\nunless there\u2019s simply no alternative. Each time segment should showcase as\nmany different topics as possible, and while it\u2019s fine for Biology and Chemistry\nto overlap with other sessions, no more than two Bio\u2011or\u2011Chem seminars may ever\nrun at the same moment.\nWith these guidelines in mind, you\u2019ll blend room capacities, projector access, \ntemporal preferences, and topic distributions into a single, seamless schedule \nthat serves presenters, attendees, and the venues\u2019 technical quirks without leaving\nunnecessary gaps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 5 doesn't have a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(R) :- room(R), R = 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI and Math require a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"AI\"), -projector(R).\n:- delivered(S, R, _, _), topicOf(S, \"Math\"), -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms can only be used twice in a day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{delivered(S, R, T, D) : seminar(S), timeslot(T)}2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each timeslot should have seminars from as many topics as possible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(To, T, D) :- delivered(S, _, T, D), topicOf(S, To).\ntopicsPerSlot(N, T, D) :- #count{To: hasTopic(To, T, D)} = N, timeslot(T), day(D).\n#maximize{N: topicsPerSlot(N, T, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Do not waste any timeslots in rooms unless necessary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wastedSlot(R, T, D) :- not delivered(_, R, T, D), room(R), timeslot(T), day(D).\nwastedSlots(N) :- #count{R, T, D: wastedSlot(R, T, D)} = N.\n#minimize{N: wastedSlots(N)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The time slots are morining, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\";

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mission begins at the CommandCenter, where an autonomous drone is prepared for a high-priority surveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight corridors. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute of flight time, but each of these corridors imposes a specific energy toll on the battery depending on altitude and weather interference. When the drone departs the CommandCenter at time zero, it has two initial options: it can take the eastern outbound lane, known as PathA, for 2 battery units, or the western lane, PathB, which requires 3 units due to its more demanding elevation profile.\n\nOnce the drone is on PathA, it has a direct route to TowerX, though approaching the tower\u2019s uplink requires an additional 2 units of battery. If the drone chooses PathB instead, it can access TowerY for a moderate cost of 2 units. Interestingly, PathB also offers a lateral link that allows the drone to jump over to PathA for just 1 battery unit. Later in the mission, should the drone need to pivot from TowerX back toward the western sector, it can move to PathB at a cost of 2 battery units. Beyond TowerY lies the restricted airspace of the MidRelay transmission node, which costs 3 units to enter. From MidRelay, there is a one-way path to TowerZ that requires 2 additional units. TowerZ itself serves as a deep-perimeter point that offers a long-range return path back to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump is expensive, hitting the battery with a 4-unit penalty.\n\nThe operational requirements for data collection are quite specific. While traveling takes only a minute, scanning any tower requires the drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal stabilization. To consider the mission a success, the drone must complete at least one full scan at both TowerX and TowerY. TowerZ is an auxiliary objective; scanning it is encouraged but not strictly required. However, we are under a tight deadline for our primary data: the scan at TowerX must be completely finalized no later than the five-minute mark of the mission. Additionally, to prevent sensor overheating and data redundancy, the drone is prohibited from performing consecutive scans at the same location.\n\nThe drone starts the operation with a full battery capacity of 14 units, and the total energy consumed across all movements cannot exceed this limit. To help manage this, the drone is permitted to idle at the MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 units of power. If you choose to use this recovery option, you must be aware of a strict routing constraint: any visit to the MidRelay requires the drone to move immediately to TowerZ in the following minute to maintain signal lock-on. \n\nAs we plan the flight path, our primary goal is to maximize the total number of tower scans performed, including the optional site at TowerZ. If you find multiple routes that yield the same maximum number of scans, you should prioritize the strategy that completes the mandatory scans at TowerX and TowerY in the shortest amount of time. Finally, keep in mind that the drone is limited to a maximum of 20 total stops throughout the mission, a count that includes every minute spent traveling, scanning, or idling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(V3, V5): loc(V3) }1 :- time(V5).\n:- at(V17, V5), at(V9, V5+1), not edge(V17, V9, _), V17 != V9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(F,Finally) :- scan_at(F,Finally).\nat(F,Finally+1) :- scan_at(F,Finally), Finally < 10.\nat(F,Finally+2) :- scan_at(F,Finally), Finally < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", Interestingly): time(Interestingly) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", Interestingly): time(Interestingly) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",P): time(P), P < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", Y): time(Y) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- Later = #count {B,R: at(B,R)}, Later > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(X+1 ,Interestingly) :- at(V7,X), at(Once,X+1), edge(V7,Once,V5), used_batt(X,M), Interestingly = M + V5.\nused_batt(X+1, Once) :- at(F,X), at(F,X+1), used_batt(X, Once).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, Once), Once > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",N), not at(\"TowerZ\",N+1), N < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(V5,O) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(V12) :- V12 = #min{C: scan_at(\"TowerX\", J), scan_at(\"TowerY\", L), C>=J, C>=L, time(C) }.\n#minimize { V12@1 : scanned_time(V12) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(A,V14), scan_at(A,N), N = V14 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,G) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,V18), G = V18-4."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nA marine survey drone emerges from SubDock into a labyrinth of \nundersea currents that define a bidirectional routing graph. \nEach current lane exacts a heat load on the drone\u2019s systems rather than \nbattery measured in heat units and all traversals take one time unit. \nThe drone starts with a maximum heat tolerance of 10\u202funits; every movement \nalong a lane adds its heat load, and it can shed all heat by lingering in \na cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\nFrom SubDock, the drone may navigate the gentle CoralPass (2\u202funits) or the \nturbulent VentStream (4\u202funits). CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap. The aim which is primary in choosing one \nof multiple possibe routes must be to avoid wasting time, that is time at which the\ndrone is not performing an acoustic pulse at any survey location."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes subdock coralpass ventstream beaconalpha deeploop beaconbeta nodex beacongamma"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bidirectional edges  heat costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: heat tolerance max 10 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement takes 1\u202fmin heat increases per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulsing at beaconalpha  beaconbeta is mandatory beacongamma optional"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: beaconalpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulse beacongamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cooldown stop at nodex for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: when at nodex next action must be either pulse at nodex or cooldown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: action limit \u2264\u202f16 moves\u202f\u202fpulses\u202f\u202fcooldowns"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: must visit ventstream between each pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: objective minimise time in which not pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units.

The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit.

Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run.

The workshops are conducted within a set of three distinct venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to a specific subject category $s \\in S$, where $S = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}, \\text{Mathematics (M)}, \\text{Biology (B)}\\}$. An assignment is defined as a mapping of a workshop to a unique triplet $(d, t, r) \\in D \\times T \\times R$.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n1.  **Exclusivity and Capacity Constraints:**\n    *   **Unit Occupancy:** For any given $(d, t, r)$, at most one workshop $w \\in W$ may be scheduled.\n    *   **Daily Room Bound:** For each room $r \\in R$ on any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled workshops $n_{d,r}$ must satisfy $1 \\le n_{d,r} \\le 2$. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one time slot per day.\n    *   **Venue Availability:** Room $r_2$ is restricted such that no workshops may be scheduled during $t_3$ on either $d_1$ or $d_2$.\n\n2.  **Subject-Specific Temporal and Spatial Constraints:**\n    *   **AI Temporal Restriction:** Workshops where $s = \\text{AI}$ must be scheduled exclusively during the morning slot $t_1$.\n    *   **Mathematics Non-Concurrency:** Let $W_M \\subset W$ be the subset of workshops where $s = \\text{M}$. For any $w_i, w_j \\in W_M$ ($i \\neq j$), the assigned time slots $(d_i, t_i)$ and $(d_j, t_j)$ must be distinct. No two Mathematics workshops may occur simultaneously, regardless of room assignment.\n    *   **Subject Segregation:** For any day $d \\in D$ and room $r \\in R$, the room may not host both a workshop of subject AI and a workshop of subject B. If an AI workshop is assigned to $(d, r, t_i)$, then no Biology workshop may be assigned to $(d, r, t_j)$ for any $t_j \\in T$, and vice versa.\n\n3.  **Distributional Requirements:**\n    *   **Daily Subject Coverage:** For each day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each subject category $s \\in S$. \n\n**Objective:**\nIdentify a feasible schedule that satisfies all aforementioned logical and physical constraints. In the event of multiple feasible solutions, the optimal schedule is defined as the one that maximizes the utilization of available spatio-temporal slots (minimizing the cardinality of the set of unused valid room-time pairs).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Define the decision variables for the scheduling problem.\n2.  Provide a formal mapping of the eight workshops to the coordinates $(d, t, r)$.\n3.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind. If you find multiple ways to satisfy all these rules, our first priority is to maximize the number of rooms in use during each session to give the event a high-energy feel. After that, we want to minimize the total number of idle room-time slots across the four days, provided it doesn't conflict with any of the other requirements. Let me know if you run into any snags while mapping this out."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 10 presentations"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: presentations are in ai cloud iot or vr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(P, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the schedule spans 4 days with 4 time slots per day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 5 rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each presentation must be scheduled"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : room(R), slot(Sl), day(D) } :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only one presentation per room\u2011time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, Sl, D), scheduled(P2, R, Sl, D), P1 != P2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each room can be used at most three times per day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : presentation(P), slot(Sl) } 3 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, R, Sl1, D), scheduled(_, R, Sl2, D), Sl1 = Sl2 - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: room 2 has no projector ai and cloud require a projector"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"AI\", -projector(R).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"Cloud\", -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: vr cannot be in room 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, 1, _, _), topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: iot presentations must be spread across at least three days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(D) :- scheduled(P, _, _, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { D : hasIoT(D) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: vr and ai cannot be on the same day in the same room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, _, D), scheduled(P2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(P1, \"VR\"), topicOf(P2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: at most two cloud and iot presentations may overlap in any slot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- day(D), slot(S), #count { P : cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only ai can be in slot 1 of day 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(P, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only vr can be in slot 3 of day 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each day must have at least one presentation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), not scheduled(_, _, _, D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: at least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(T, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, T).\n:- slot(Sl), day(D), #count { T : hasTopic(T, Sl, D) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: maximize the number of rooms used per slot then minimize idle slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, Sl, D) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl, D).\nroomsUsed(N, Sl, D) :- N = #count { R : used(R, Sl, D) }, slot(Sl), day(D).\n#maximize { N@2 : roomsUsed(N, Sl, D) }.\nidle(R, Sl, D) :- room(R), slot(Sl), day(D), not used(R, Sl, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, Sl, D: idle(R, Sl, D) }.\n#minimize { N@1: num_idle(N) }."}]}

The primary mission objective is to conduct a thorough inspection of both OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once. While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.\n\nNavigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover\u2019s limited six-unit battery. Furthermore, once the rover arrives at a destination, it must remain stationary for a full minute to complete its scanning sequence. The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation. Similarly, Fork2 provides a path to OutpostY as well as an alternate route to the RelayStation.\n\nThere is a specific incentive for efficiency regarding the optional RelayStation visit. The diagnostic reward offered there is only granted if the rover manages to complete both mandatory inspections at OutpostX and OutpostY while still having more than two units of battery power remaining in its reserves.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise 4.12: Autonomous Path Planning with Resource and Temporal Constraints**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nAn autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is deployed into a subterranean hydraulic network, modeled as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$. The agent must execute a sampling mission subject to strict volumetric, temporal, and operational constraints.\n\n**1. Network Topology and Edge Weights:**\nThe vertex set is defined as $V = \\{v_{LP}, v_A, v_B, v_C, v_{CE}\\}$, representing the LaunchPad, Station A, Station B, Station C, and a Calibration Shaft, respectively. The directed edges $E$ and their associated volumetric costs $w(e)$ (reduction in tank capacity) are defined as follows:\n*   $e_1: (v_{LP}, v_A), w(e_1) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_2: (v_{LP}, v_B), w(e_2) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_3: (v_A, v_B), w(e_3) = 1\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_4: (v_{LP}, v_{CE}), w(e_4) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_5: (v_{CE}, v_C), w(e_5) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_6: (v_C, v_A), w(e_6) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Agent Capabilities:**\n*   **Time ($t$):** The mission begins at $t=0$. Every traversal of an edge $e \\in E$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute.\n*   **Tank Capacity ($C$):** The agent possesses an internal reservoir with a maximum capacity $C_{max} = 16\\,\\text{L}$. The initial state is $C_0 = 16\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Sampling:** Collecting a specimen at any station $v \\in \\{v_A, v_B, v_C\\}$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute and reduces $C$ by $1\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Refilling:** At $v_{CE}$, the agent may perform a one-time refill operation, increasing $C$ by $3\\,\\text{L}$ (not to exceed $C_{max}$). This operation requires $\\Delta t = 2$ consecutive minutes of idling.\n*   **Event Counter ($k$):** The total sequence of discrete actions (traversals, samplings, and refills) is limited to $k \\le 18$.\n\n**3. Mission Constraints:**\nThe agent\u2019s path must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   **Mandatory Samples:** The agent must successfully perform at least one sampling operation at $v_A$ and $v_B$.\n*   **Temporal Deadlines:** The first sampling operation at $v_A$ must be completed such that $t \\le 6$.\n*   **Optional Sampling:** A sampling operation at $v_C$ is permissible **if and only if** the first instances of sampling at both $v_A$ and $v_B$ are completed within the interval $t \\in [0, 8]$.\n*   **Resource Integrity:** At no point in the mission may $C < 0$.\n*   **Cross-Contamination Protocol:** The agent is prohibited from performing two consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex.\n\n**4. Optimization Objectives:**\nFormulate a path $\\mathcal{P}$ that satisfies all constraints while optimizing the following criteria in lexicographical order:\n1.  **Maximize** the total number of samples collected $N_{total}$.\n2.  **Minimize** the completion time $t_{final}$ of the last mandatory sample ($v_A$ or $v_B$).\n\n**Required:**\na) Provide the state-space representation of the AUV.\nb) Determine if an optimal path exists that includes Station C. If so, provide the sequence of actions and the final state $(t, C, k)$.\nc) Prove whether the volume constraint $C_{max}$ or the temporal constraint $t_{max}=10$ is the primary limiting factor for $N_{total}$."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Locations: HubWest, NodeA, NodeB, Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"HubWest\"; \"NodeA\"; \"NodeB\"; \"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes costs 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Max duration: 9 minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..9)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Edges: (HubWest\u2013NodeA), (HubWest\u2013NodeB), (NodeA\u2013Sensor1), (NodeB\u2013Sensor2), (NodeA\u2013NodeB)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeA\").\nedge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeB\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"Sensor1\").\nedge(\"NodeB\", \"Sensor2\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"NodeB\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize time by which both samples are completed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "latest_inspect(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(_, T1) }.\n#minimize { T : latest_inspect(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start location: HubWest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"HubWest\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If NodeB is visited before Sensor1, then NodeA may not be visited afterward"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeB\", T1), at(\"Sensor1\", T2), at(\"NodeA\", T3), T1 < T2 < T3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling targets: Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "inspect(\"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each sample requires a full minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(L, T) : time(T) } 1 :- inspect(L).\nat(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: A minimum of three timesteps between samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- inspect_at(_, T1), inspect_at(_, T2), 0 < T1 - T2 < 3."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit\nconsecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(J, Q): loc(J) }1 :- time(Q).\n:- at(V15, Q), at(M, Q+1), not edge(V15, M, _), V15 != M."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(V6,Continuing) :- scan_at(V6,Continuing).\nat(V6,Continuing+1) :- scan_at(V6,Continuing), Continuing < 10.\nat(V6,Continuing+2) :- scan_at(V6,Continuing), Continuing < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", C): time(C) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", C): time(C) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",D): time(D), D < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", V7): time(V7) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- V7 = #count {V2,V10: at(V2,V10)}, V7 > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(V19+1 ,V0) :- at(V18,V19), at(V5,V19+1), edge(V18,V5,V8), used_batt(V19,V10), V0 = V10 + V8.\nused_batt(V19+1, V3) :- at(V11,V19), at(V11,V19+1), used_batt(V19, V3).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, V3), V3 > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",P), not at(\"TowerZ\",P+1), P < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(V5,S) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(V7) :- V7 = #min{W: scan_at(\"TowerX\", V), scan_at(\"TowerY\", C), W>=V, W>=C, time(W) }.\n#minimize { V7@1 : scanned_time(V7) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(M,S), scan_at(M,Continuing), Continuing = S + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(V15) :- at(\"MidRelay\",V15), at(\"MidRelay\",V15+1), at(\"MidRelay\",V15+2), V15 < 9.\nused_batt(V15+1,M) :- recharge(V15), used_batt(V15,M), M = M-4."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAs our autonomous rover prepares to navigate the subterranean tunnel network of the Mars base, we need to carefully map out its trajectory from the LaunchPad. The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.\n\nEvery movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system. Our ultimate goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected. In the event that multiple routes yield the same number of samples, we will prioritize the plan that completes the mandatory sampling at StationA and StationB in the shortest amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes launchpad tunnel1 tunnel2 stationa stationb tunnel3 calibedge stationc"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges  water costs l"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: start at launchpad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement 1\u202fmin per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: tank capacity 16\u202fl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: mandatory samples stationa stationb exactly once each"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: sampling 1\u202fmin 1\u202fl per sample"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: refill at calibedge 2 min \u2192 3l at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationa must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationc sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: event limit \u2264 18 events moves  samples  refill"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: primary maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: secondary minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe have a significant puzzle to solve regarding the upcoming two-day research symposium. We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum.

The configuration requires the selection of exactly one entity from each of four discrete component categories: Processor ($P$), Graphics Processing Unit ($G$), Motherboard ($M$), and Power Supply Unit ($S$). Each component is associated with a specific cost, and the objective is to identify a feasible configuration $(p, g, m, s)$ that minimizes the total cost function, $\\mathcal{C}_{total} = c(p) + c(g) + c(m) + c(s)$, subject to a set of logical and hardware compatibility constraints.\n\n**Component Domains and Cost Functions:**\nLet the sets of available components and their corresponding costs (in arbitrary currency units) be defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Processors ($P$):**\n    *   $p_1$: Ryzen7 ($c = 300$)\n    *   $p_2$: i9 ($c = 400$)\n    *   $p_3$: Xeon ($c = 500$)\n2.  **Graphics Processing Units ($G$):**\n    *   $g_1$: RTX4060 ($c = 350$)\n    *   $g_2$: RTX3090 ($c = 700$)\n    *   $g_3$: Quadro ($c = 800$)\n3.  **Motherboards ($M$):**\n    *   $m_1$: X670 ($c = 180$)\n    *   $m_2$: Z690 ($c = 200$)\n    *   $m_3$: C621 ($c = 250$)\n4.  **Power Supply Units ($S$):**\n    *   $s_1$: Bronze ($c = 80$)\n    *   $s_2$: Gold ($c = 120$)\n    *   $s_3$: Platinum ($c = 160$)\n\n**System Constraints:**\nThe selection must satisfy the following logical predicates:\n\n1.  **Power Capacity Constraint:** High-wattage GPUs ($g_2, g_3$) are incompatible with the entry-level power supply ($s_1$).\n    *   $(g \\in \\{g_2, g_3\\}) \\implies (s \\neq s_1)$\n2.  **Processor-Socket Compatibility:** The server-grade processor ($p_3$) necessitates the workstation-class motherboard ($m_3$).\n    *   $(p = p_3) \\implies (m = m_3)$\n3.  **Chipset Specificity (AMD):** The $p_1$ architecture is strictly limited to the $m_1$ motherboard.\n    *   $(p = p_1) \\implies (m = m_1)$\n4.  **Chipset Specificity (Intel):** The $p_2$ processor cannot be paired with the $m_1$ motherboard.\n    *   $(p = p_2) \\implies (m \\neq m_1)$\n5.  **Workstation GPU Dependency:** The use of a Quadro GPU ($g_3$) requires the installation of a Xeon processor ($p_3$).\n    *   $(g = g_3) \\implies (p = p_3)$\n6.  **Motherboard Incompatibility:** The Quadro GPU ($g_3$) is incompatible with the $m_2$ motherboard.\n    *   $(g = g_3) \\implies (m \\neq m_2)$\n\n**Required:**\n1.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAs our autonomous rover prepares to navigate the subterranean tunnel network of the Mars base, we need to carefully map out its trajectory from the LaunchPad. The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.\n\nEvery movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system. Our ultimate goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected. In the event that multiple routes yield the same number of samples, we will prioritize the plan that completes the mandatory sampling at StationA and StationB in the shortest amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start at launchpad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement: 1\u202fmin per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(V14, V12): loc(V14) }1 :- time(V12).\n:- at(K, V12), at(C, V12+1), not edge(K, C, _), K != C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Tank Capacity: 16\u202fL."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(J+1, V19) :- tank(J, N), at(V1,J), at(V8,J+1), edge(V1,V8,V12), V19 = N - V12.\n:- tank(_, E), E < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB (exactly once each)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",V0): time(V0) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",V0): time(V0) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",V0): time(V0) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling: 1\u202fmin, +1\u202fL per sample."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(Y,V3) :- sampled(Y,V3).\nat(Y,V3+1) :- sampled(Y,V3).\ntank(V3+1,D+1) :- tank(V3,D), sampled(Y,V3), D<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Refill at CalibEdge: 2 min \u2192 +3L, at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(K) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",K), at(\"CalibEdge\",K+1).\n:- refill(V6), refill(L), V6 != L.\ntank(K+2, Mars + 3) :- tank(K,Mars), refill(K), Mars < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(V12,H), sampled(V12,K), K = H+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationA must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",Z): time(Z), Z <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",A), sampled(\"StationB\",K), max(A,K) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Event Limit: \u2264 18 events (moves + samples + refill)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(F) :- at(O,F-1), at(V18,F), O != V18.\nevent(F) :- sampled(_,F).\nevent(F) :- refill(F).\n:- S = #count {V4: event(V4)}, S>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Primary: maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(V19) :- V19 = #count {V18: sampled(V,V18)}.\n#maximize { V19@2: samples(V19) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Secondary: minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(Once) :- Once = #min{V9: sampled(\"StationA\",V12), sampled(\"StationB\",V18), V9>=V12, V9>=V18, time(V9) }.\n#minimize { Once@1: mtime(Once) }."}]}

The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.\n\nEvery movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system. Our ultimate goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected. In the event that multiple routes yield the same number of samples, we will prioritize the plan that completes the mandatory sampling at StationA and StationB in the shortest amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start at launchpad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement: 1\u202fmin per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Tank Capacity: 16\u202fL."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB (exactly once each)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling: 1\u202fmin, +1\u202fL per sample."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Refill at CalibEdge: 2 min \u2192 +3L, at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationA must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Event Limit: \u2264 18 events (moves + samples + refill)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Primary: maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Secondary: minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}]}

We\u2019re dealing with ten seminars across four fields\u2014Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Mathematics, and Chemistry\u2014and we need to fit them into a schedule that spans four segments each day: morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five distinct rooms available, but the logistics are a bit of a balancing act.\n\nFirst, we have to respect the physical limits of the venue and the comfort of our attendees. Naturally, no room can host more than one seminar at a time. To ensure the facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed, no single room can be booked for more than half of the available time slots in a single day. Beyond that, we have to avoid scheduling back-to-back sessions in the same room; every presentation needs a buffer period before and after it. We also have some specific room limitations to keep in mind: Room 3 goes offline entirely once the afternoon begins, and Room 5 lacks any projection equipment.\n\nThe technology requirements for our speakers are quite specific. Both the AI and Mathematics presenters require a working projector for their slides, which means they can never be scheduled in Room 5. Additionally, the AI teams have a strong preference for early starts, so their sessions must be confined to the morning or late-morning slots. To frame the event properly, we\u2019ve decided that the symposium must open and close with Mathematics, meaning the very first seminar of the first day and the final seminar of the second day must both be Math sessions.\n\nWhen it comes to the sciences, Biology and Chemistry have their own unique scheduling hurdles. Biology seminars must be distributed across both days of the symposium; we cannot have all of them occur on just one day. We also need to ensure that no two Biology talks ever take place simultaneously. Chemistry is a bit different; while they can overlap in time, no two Chemistry talks can ever occupy the same room throughout the entire event. Furthermore, we cannot mix Biology and Chemistry sessions in the same room on any given day, so those two fields must stay under different roofs if they are scheduled for the same date.\n\nAs we piece this together, our goal is to maintain a high level of variety and momentum. We want to avoid empty time slots unless there is absolutely no other choice, and we should strive to showcase as many different topics as possible during each time segment. However, we have to keep an eye on the total volume of science talks: at any given moment, we can have no more than two seminars running simultaneously if they are from the Biology or Chemistry fields. If we can balance these technical quirks and room capacities, we\u2019ll have a seamless program that serves both our presenters and our guests."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars are on AI, Bio, Math, or Chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\";

Each day is partitioned into a set of three contiguous time slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$, representing morning, midday, and afternoon, respectively.

An assignment is defined as a mapping of a workshop to a unique triplet $(d, t, r) \\in D \\times T \\times R$.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n1.  **Exclusivity and Capacity Constraints:**\n    *   **Unit Occupancy:** For any given $(d, t, r)$, at most one workshop $w \\in W$ may be scheduled.\n    *   **Daily Room Bound:** For each room $r \\in R$ on any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled workshops $n_{d,r}$ must satisfy $1 \\le n_{d,r} \\le 2$. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one time slot per day.\n    *   **Venue Availability:** Room $r_2$ is restricted such that no workshops may be scheduled during $t_3$ on either $d_1$ or $d_2$.\n\n2.  **Subject-Specific Temporal and Spatial Constraints:**\n    *   **AI Temporal Restriction:** Workshops where $s = \\text{AI}$ must be scheduled exclusively during the morning slot $t_1$.\n    *   **Mathematics Non-Concurrency:** Let $W_M \\subset W$ be the subset of workshops where $s = \\text{M}$. For any $w_i, w_j \\in W_M$ ($i \\neq j$), the assigned time slots $(d_i, t_i)$ and $(d_j, t_j)$ must be distinct.

Formally, for any $s_i, s_j \\in S$, if $s_i \\neq s_j$, then $f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$.\n2.  **Domain Restriction (Spatial-Temporal Exclusion):** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the final temporal period $t_{afternoon}$. For any $s_i \\in S$, if $f(s_i) = (t, r)$, then $(t, r) \\neq (t_{afternoon}, r_3)$.\n3.  **Unary Spatial Constraint:** Seminar $s_1$ must be allocated to room $r_1$, regardless of the temporal assignment. Formally, let $f(s_1) = (t, r)$; it must hold that $r = r_1$.\n4.  **Binary Temporal Constraint (Mutual Exclusion):** Seminars $s_2$ and $s_3$ are subject to a temporal disjointness constraint. If $f(s_2) = (t_a, r_b)$ and $f(s_3) = (t_c, r_d)$, then $t_a \\neq t_c$.\n\n**Task:**\n1.  Represent this problem by defining the variables, domains, and the explicit set of constraints.\n2.

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile. When choosing between valid routes, the primary objective is to minimize \"inactive time\"\u2014defined as any time spent on transits or cooldowns rather than on acoustic calibrations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous rover is tasked with collecting critical samples in a subterranean Mars base tunnel network. The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations. If multiple route \nplans achieve the same sample count, priority should be given to the plan that completes the mandatory sampling \noperations (StationA and StationB) in the least amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes launchpad tunnel1 tunnel2 stationa stationb tunnel3 calibedge stationc"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges  water costs l"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: start at launchpad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement 1\u202fmin per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: tank capacity 16\u202fl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: mandatory samples stationa stationb exactly once each"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: sampling 1\u202fmin 1\u202fl per sample"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: refill at calibedge 2 min \u2192 3l at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationa must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: stationc sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: event limit \u2264 18 events moves  samples  refill"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: primary maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: secondary minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Multi-Agent Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement**\nAn academic institution is organizing a two-day research symposium consisting of ten discrete seminars. Each seminar $s \\in S$ is categorized into one of four disjoint fields $F = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology (B), Mathematics (M), Chemistry (C)}\\}$. The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$). Each day is partitioned into four sequential segments: morning ($t_1$), late morning ($t_2$), early afternoon ($t_3$), and late afternoon ($t_4$).\n*   **Spatial Domain:** There are five distinct venues available ($R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$).\n*   **Capacity:** Each room may host at most one seminar per time segment.\n\n**2. Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4. Global Optimization Objectives**\nThe resulting schedule must satisfy the following meta-conditions:\n*   **Gap Minimization:** The schedule should minimize idle time segments between the first and last seminar of each day.\n*   **Field Diversity:** Within any single time segment $t$, the schedule must maximize the variety of fields represented across different rooms.\n*   **Concurrency Limits:** At any time $t$, the total number of concurrent seminars from the set $\\{B, C\\}$ must not exceed two.\n\n**Assignment**\nFormulate this problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap.

The agent must execute a sequence of operations\u2014comprising movement, resource acquisition, and site sampling\u2014subject to strict temporal, resource, and logical constraints.\n\n**System Specifications**\n1.  **Graph Topology**: The vertex set $V$ consists of the following locations: $\\{\\text{LaunchPad (LP)}, \\text{Tunnel1 (T1)}, \\text{Tunnel2 (T2)}, \\text{Tunnel3 (T3)}, \\text{StationA (SA)}, \\text{StationB (SB)}, \\text{StationC (SC)}, \\text{CalibEdge (CE)}\\}$.\n2.  **Edge Definitions and Costs**: Transitions between vertices are directed and incur costs in time ($t$), events ($e$), and water ($w$). Every directed edge $(u, v)$ has a uniform time cost $\\Delta t = 1$ and event cost $\\Delta e = 1$. Water consumption $\\Delta w$ for each transition is defined as follows:\n    *   $(LP, T1): 2L$\n    *   $(LP, T2): 3L$\n    *   $(T1, SA): 1L$\n    *   $(SA, T3): 1L$\n    *   $(T3, T2): 0L$\n    *   $(T2, SB): 1L$\n    *   $(T2, CE): 2L$\n    *   $(CE, SC): 1L$\n    *   $(SC, T1): 2L$\n\n**Operational Constraints**\n*   **Initial State**: At $t=0$, the agent is at $LP$ with $w = 16L$ and $e = 0$.\n*   **Global Limits**: The mission must terminate such that total elapsed time $T \\le 10$ minutes and total accumulated events $E \\le 18$. The water level $w$ must satisfy $0 \\le w \\le 16$ at all times.\n*   **Sampling Operations**: \n    *   Sampling at a station $S_i \\in \\{SA, SB, SC\\}$ requires $\\Delta t = 1$ and $\\Delta e = 1$.\n    *   Each sampling operation yields a resource recovery of $+1L$ water.\n    *   Station $SA$ and $SB$ must be sampled exactly once.\n    *   Sampling at $SA$ must occur at $t \\le 6$.\n    *   **Conditional Constraint**: $SC$ must be sampled if and only if the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed by $t \\le 8$.\n    *   **Protocol Constraint**: Consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex are prohibited.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol**: At vertex $CE$, the agent may perform a \"Refill\" action. This action requires $\\Delta t = 2$ (consecutive) and $\\Delta e = 2$, resulting in a resource gain of $+3L$ water. This action is restricted to a single occurrence per mission.\n\n**Objective Function**\nLet $N$ be the total number of unique stations sampled. Let $T_{mandatory}$ be the time at which the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed.\n1.  Maximize $N$.\n2.  Subject to the maximum of $N$, minimize $T_{mandatory}$.\n\n**Task**\nFormulate the optimal state-transition sequence that satisfies all aforementioned conditions.

Each lecture $l_i$ is associated with a specific subject $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$, where $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Physics}\\}$. \n\nThe objective is to define a feasible assignment of these lectures into a spatio-temporal domain defined by:\n1.  A set of discrete time slots $\\mathcal{T} = \\{t_{morning}, t_{afternoon}\\}$.\n2.  A set of physical venues $\\mathcal{R} = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nLet an assignment be a function $\\sigma: \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{R}$, where each lecture is mapped to a unique (time, room) tuple. A valid schedule must satisfy the following formal conditions:\n\n**Condition I: Resource Uniqueness (Injective Mapping)**\nThe mapping $\\sigma$ must be injective with respect to the codomain $\\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{R}$. Formally, for any two distinct lectures $l_i, l_j \\in \\mathcal{L}$, $\\sigma(l_i) \\neq \\sigma(l_j)$. This precludes the simultaneous occupancy of a single room by multiple lectures.\n\n**Condition II: Subject-Based Spatial Exclusion**\nDefine a function $f: \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathcal{S}$ that maps each lecture to its respective subject. For any pair of lectures $(l_i, l_j)$, if $f(l_i) = \\text{Mathematics}$ and $f(l_j) = \\text{Physics}$, their assigned rooms must be disjoint, regardless of the temporal component. That is:\n$$\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\sigma(l_j))$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_{\\mathcal{R}}$ denotes the projection of the assignment onto the set of rooms.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

A total of five rooms are available throughout\nthe event.\nEach of the ten presentations must be scheduled \u2014 no omissions \u2014 and\nonly one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind. If you find multiple ways to satisfy all these rules, our first priority is to maximize the number of rooms in use during each session to give the event a high-energy feel. After that, we want to minimize the total number of idle room-time slots across the four days, provided it doesn't conflict with any of the other requirements.

To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.\n\n### Foundational Protocols\n1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.\n2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.\n3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.\n4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums.

Each component is associated with a specific cost, and the objective is to identify a feasible configuration $(p, g, m, s)$ that minimizes the total cost function, $\\mathcal{C}_{total} = c(p) + c(g) + c(m) + c(s)$, subject to a set of logical and hardware compatibility constraints.\n\n**Component Domains and Cost Functions:**\nLet the sets of available components and their corresponding costs (in arbitrary currency units) be defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Processors ($P$):**\n    *   $p_1$: Ryzen7 ($c = 300$)\n    *   $p_2$: i9 ($c = 400$)\n    *   $p_3$: Xeon ($c = 500$)\n2.  **Graphics Processing Units ($G$):**\n    *   $g_1$: RTX4060 ($c = 350$)\n    *   $g_2$: RTX3090 ($c = 700$)\n    *   $g_3$: Quadro ($c = 800$)\n3.  **Motherboards ($M$):**\n    *   $m_1$: X670 ($c = 180$)\n    *   $m_2$: Z690 ($c = 200$)\n    *   $m_3$: C621 ($c = 250$)\n4.  **Power Supply Units ($S$):**\n    *   $s_1$: Bronze ($c = 80$)\n    *   $s_2$: Gold ($c = 120$)\n    *   $s_3$: Platinum ($c = 160$)\n\n**System Constraints:**\nThe selection must satisfy the following logical predicates:\n\n1.  **Power Capacity Constraint:** High-wattage GPUs ($g_2, g_3$) are incompatible with the entry-level power supply ($s_1$).\n    *   $(g \\in \\{g_2, g_3\\}) \\implies (s \\neq s_1)$\n2.  **Processor-Socket Compatibility:** The server-grade processor ($p_3$) necessitates the workstation-class motherboard ($m_3$).\n    *   $(p = p_3) \\implies (m = m_3)$\n3.  **Chipset Specificity (AMD):** The $p_1$ architecture is strictly limited to the $m_1$ motherboard.\n    *   $(p = p_1) \\implies (m = m_1)$\n4.  **Chipset Specificity (Intel):** The $p_2$ processor cannot be paired with the $m_1$ motherboard.\n    *   $(p = p_2) \\implies (m \\neq m_1)$\n5.  **Workstation GPU Dependency:** The use of a Quadro GPU ($g_3$) requires the installation of a Xeon processor ($p_3$).\n    *   $(g = g_3) \\implies (p = p_3)$\n6.  **Motherboard Incompatibility:** The Quadro GPU ($g_3$) is incompatible with the $m_2$ motherboard.\n    *   $(g = g_3) \\implies (m \\neq m_2)$\n\n**Required:**\n1.  Formulate the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).\n2.  Evaluate the feasible region by identifying all combinations that satisfy the constraints.\n3.

It must collect samples at StationA \nand StationB, but can optionally sample at StationC if time allows. \nThe aqueducts are one\u2011way tunnels, each carrying a distinct water volume \ncost that reduces the drone\u2019s internal tank capacity (max 16\u202fL). Moving \nthrough any tunnel takes exactly 1\u202fminute, and collecting a sample at a \nstation requires 1\u202fminute and fills 1\u202fL.\nFrom LaunchPad, two connectors diverge: Tunnel1 (cost 2\u202fL) and Tunnel2 \n(cost 3\u202fL).

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of coordinating a series of eight graduate workshops scheduled over the course of two days. Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible. While we must strictly adhere to all these rules, we want to minimize the number of unused room-time slots across the two-day period."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 8 graduate workshops."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio and AI cannot be in the same room on the same day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, _, D), scheduled(W2, R, _, D), topicOf(W1, \"Bio\"), topicOf(W2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two Math workshops can be scheduled at the same time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, _, S, D), scheduled(W2, _, S, D), topicOf(W1, \"Math\"), topicOf(W2, \"Math\"), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one workshop can be in a room at a time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, S, D), scheduled(W2, R, S, D), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Try to minimize idle room slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, S, D) :- scheduled(_, R, S, D).\nidle(R, S, D) :- room(R), slot(S), day(D), not used(R, S, D).\n#minimize {1, R, S, D : idle(R, S, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each workshop must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 {scheduled(W, R, S, D) : room(R), slot(S), day(D)} :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 is not available in the afternoon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 2, \"afternoon\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Workshops are in AI, Math, or Bio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Math\"; \"Bio\").\n1 {topicOf(W, T) : topic(T)} 1 :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most twice per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{scheduled(W, R, S, D) : workshop(W), slot(S)} 2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 2 days, with 3 time slots per day: morning, midday, and afternoon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..2).\nslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 3 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI workshops must be in the morning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, S, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\"), S != \"morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least one workshop of each topic must be held on each day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), topic(T), not scheduled(W, _, _, D) : topicOf(W, T)."}]}

The catch is that we have to be very careful about how we pair them up to ensure the system actually works. \n\nFor instance, the Alpha speaker is a bit finicky and will only work if we use AmpX to power it. On the digital side, we have to remember that AmpY and Streamer1 are completely incompatible with each other, so those two can never be used in the same configuration. To make matters even more complicated, the Streamer2 is designed with a very specific output that only functions when it's paired with the Beta speaker.

Moving \nthrough any tunnel takes exactly 1\u202fminute, and collecting a sample at a \nstation requires 1\u202fminute and fills 1\u202fL.\nFrom LaunchPad, two connectors diverge: Tunnel1 (cost 2\u202fL) and Tunnel2 \n(cost 3\u202fL).

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are currently finalizing the layout for our upcoming three-day symposium, which will feature a total of twelve workshops spread across four key disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Mathematics, and Linguistics. The event is hosted in a venue with four rooms, and each day is structured into three distinct sessions consisting of a morning, a midday, and an evening slot. Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.\n\nAs we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly. No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.\n\nThematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.\n\nTo keep the daily schedule organized, we\u2019ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won\u2019t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.\n\nOur objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules.

The primary mission objective is to conduct a thorough inspection of both OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once. While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.\n\nNavigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover\u2019s limited six-unit battery. Furthermore, once the rover arrives at a destination, it must remain stationary for a full minute to complete its scanning sequence. The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation. Similarly, Fork2 provides a path to OutpostY as well as an alternate route to the RelayStation.\n\nThere is a specific incentive for efficiency regarding the optional RelayStation visit. The diagnostic reward offered there is only granted if the rover manages to complete both mandatory inspections at OutpostX and OutpostY while still having more than two units of battery power remaining in its reserves.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn automated underwater vehicle (AUV) is launched from a Surface Hub to perform a critical inspection of several submerged research stations linked by a web of one-way navigational currents. Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed. If two paths result in the same number of sweeps, the strategy that completes the mandatory sweeps (X and Y) in the shortest total time is preferred.\n*   **Sensor Safety:** To prevent equipment fatigue, the AUV is strictly forbidden from performing back-to-back sensor sweeps at the same station."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(Alpha, V15): loc(Alpha) }1 :- time(V15).\n:- at(V, V15), at(Q, V15+1), not edge(V, Q, _), V != Q."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(Protocol,Costs) :- scan_at(Protocol,Costs).\nat(Protocol,Costs+1) :- scan_at(Protocol,Costs), Costs < 10.\nat(Protocol,Costs+2) :- scan_at(Protocol,Costs), Costs < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", B): time(B) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", B): time(B) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",Hierarchy): time(Hierarchy), Hierarchy < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", V16): time(V16) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- W = #count {S,L: at(S,L)}, W > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(H+1 ,I) :- at(Channel,H), at(V5,H+1), edge(Channel,V5,Time), used_batt(H,K), I = K + Time.\nused_batt(H+1, X) :- at(D,H), at(D,H+1), used_batt(H, X).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, X), X > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",However), not at(\"TowerZ\",However+1), However < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(Q,Costs) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(X) :- X = #min{C: scan_at(\"TowerX\", K), scan_at(\"TowerY\", R), C>=K, C>=R, time(C) }.\n#minimize { X@1 : scanned_time(X) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(Once,Protocol), scan_at(Once,P), P = Protocol + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(Temporal) :- at(\"MidRelay\",Temporal), at(\"MidRelay\",Temporal+1), at(\"MidRelay\",Temporal+2), Temporal < 9.\nused_batt(Temporal+1,V12) :- recharge(Temporal), used_batt(Temporal,Conversely), V12 = Conversely-4."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit\nconsecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes commandcenter patha pathb towerx towery midrelay towerz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: directed edges and movement costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone starts at commandcenter at time 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 full minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone must scan towerx and towery at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerx must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: towerz can be scanned optionally"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the total number of location visits must not exceed 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: if the drone visits midrelay then it must be at towerz in the next timestep"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: as a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at midrelay"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400. It\u2019s going to take some careful balancing to make sure we meet all these requirements without the whole thing blowing up\u2014literally or financially."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPUs = {BoltX, HydraPro, LiteCore};"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"BoltX\"; \"HydraPro\"; \"LiteCore\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Wattages: [BoltX: 85, HydraPro: 125, LiteCore: 60]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "watt(\"BoltX\", 85; \"HydraPro\", 125; \"LiteCore\", 60)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Costs: [BoltX: 400, HydraPro: 550, LiteCore: 350]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"BoltX\", 400; \"HydraPro\", 550; \"LiteCore\", 350)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPUs = {StormZ, Nebula9, VegaLite};"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "gpu(\"StormZ\"; \"Nebula9\"; \"VegaLite\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Wattages: [StormZ: 180, Nebula9: 150, VegaLite: 95]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "watt(\"StormZ\", 180; \"Nebula9\", 150; \"VegaLite\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Costs: [StormZ: 800, Nebula9: 650, VegaLite: 500]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"StormZ\", 800; \"Nebula9\", 650; \"VegaLite\", 500)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: PSUs = {PowerMax750, Eco600, Titan900};"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "psu(\"PowerMax750\"; \"Eco600\"; \"Titan900\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Capacities: [PowerMax750: 750, Eco600: 600, Titan900: 900]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "capacity(\"PowerMax750\", 750; \"Eco600\", 600; \"Titan900\", 900)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Costs: [PowerMax750: 200, Eco600: 150, Titan900: 250]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"PowerMax750\", 200; \"Eco600\", 150; \"Titan900\", 250)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select one CPU, one GPU, one PSU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(Q) : cpu(Q) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(V10) : gpu(V10) } 1.\n1 { selected_psu(P) : psu(P) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Total CPU+GPU draw \u2264 PSU capacity - 100."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected_total_draw(H) :- selected_cpu(V3), selected_gpu(L), watt(V3, S), watt(L, V8), H = S + V8.\n:- selected_psu(V18), selected_total_draw(H), capacity(V18, R), H > R - 100."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Most power-hungry part must also be most expensive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(V3) :- selected_cpu(V3).\nselected(V3) :- selected_gpu(V3).\nselected(V3) :- selected_psu(V3).\nmax_watt(V3) :- watt(V3, U), U = #max {V5 : selected(R), watt(R, V5)}.\nmax_cost(V3) :- cost(V3, Finally), Finally = #max {V3 : selected(R), cost(R, V3)}.\n:- selected(V3), max_watt(V3), not max_cost(V3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Incompatible pairs: (HydraPro, VegaLite), (Eco600, StormZ)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"HydraPro\"), selected_gpu(\"VegaLite\").\n:- selected_psu(\"Eco600\"), selected_gpu(\"StormZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Do not select all three cheapest components"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cheapest_cpu(V13) :- cpu(V13), cost(V13, I), I = #min {Hey : cpu(V17), cost(V17, Hey)}.\ncheapest_gpu(Finally) :- gpu(Finally), cost(Finally, I), I = #min {Hey : gpu(V5), cost(V5, Hey)}.\ncheapest_psu(V1) :- psu(V1), cost(V1, I), I = #min {Hey : psu(X), cost(X, Hey)}.\n:- selected_cpu(V13), cheapest_cpu(V13), selected_gpu(Finally), cheapest_gpu(Finally), selected_psu(V1), cheapest_psu(V1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two selected components can differ in cost by more than $400."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(D), selected(They), cost(D, C), cost(They, V15), C - V15 > 400.\n:- selected(D), selected(They), cost(They, V15), cost(D, C), V15 - C > 400."}]}

The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations.

Water consumption $\\Delta w$ for each transition is defined as follows:\n    *   $(LP, T1): 2L$\n    *   $(LP, T2): 3L$\n    *   $(T1, SA): 1L$\n    *   $(SA, T3): 1L$\n    *   $(T3, T2): 0L$\n    *   $(T2, SB): 1L$\n    *   $(T2, CE): 2L$\n    *   $(CE, SC): 1L$\n    *   $(SC, T1): 2L$\n\n**Operational Constraints**\n*   **Initial State**: At $t=0$, the agent is at $LP$ with $w = 16L$ and $e = 0$.\n*   **Global Limits**: The mission must terminate such that total elapsed time $T \\le 10$ minutes and total accumulated events $E \\le 18$.

It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units).

From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory.

Each seminar $s \\in S$ is categorized into one of four disjoint fields $F = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology (B), Mathematics (M), Chemistry (C)}\\}$. The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$). Each day is partitioned into four sequential segments: morning ($t_1$), late morning ($t_2$), early afternoon ($t_3$), and late afternoon ($t_4$).\n*   **Spatial Domain:** There are five distinct venues available ($R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$).\n*   **Capacity:** Each room may host at most one seminar per time segment.\n\n**2. Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4. Global Optimization Objectives**\nThe resulting schedule must satisfy the following meta-conditions:\n*   **Gap Minimization:** The schedule should minimize idle time segments between the first and last seminar of each day.\n*   **Field Diversity:** Within any single time segment $t$, the schedule must maximize the variety of fields represented across different rooms.\n*   **Concurrency Limits:** At any time $t$, the total number of concurrent seminars from the set $\\{B, C\\}$ must not exceed two.\n\n**Assignment**\nFormulate this problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Define the variables, domains, and formalize the constraints using first-order logic or algebraic inequalities.

The layout of this network is quite specific: from our starting position at point 1, the drone can fly directly to either point 2 or point 3, but point 4 is a bit more isolated and can only be reached by traveling through point 2. Because of the way the navigation system is programmed, the drone is strictly limited to moving between these directly adjacent locations.\n\nThe mission objective is to ensure that both point 3 and point 4 are scanned during the flight, though the drone operator can decide which of those two targets to visit first. Timing is the most rigid part of this operation; the drone\u2019s flight path must last for exactly five time units. Since every single move from one point to the next consumes exactly one unit of time, the drone will need to make a total of five hops across the network.

The vertex set $V$ defines the set of industrial facilities and routing nodes: $V = \\{S_1, J_1, J_2, A, B\\}$, where $S_1$ denotes the deployment station, $J_1$ and $J_2$ represent junction nodes, and $A$ and $B$ represent substations requiring inspection. The set of undirected edges $E$ is defined by the following adjacency relations:\n*   $S_1$ is adjacent to $\\{J_1, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_1$ is adjacent to $\\{A, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_2$ is adjacent to $\\{B, J_1\\}$\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Task Requirements:** The agent must perform an inspection operation at both $A$ and $B$ at least once. An inspection is defined as a stationary action performed at a target vertex.\n2.  **Energy Model:** \n    *   **Traversal Cost:** The transition between any two adjacent vertices $u, v \\in V$ incurs a constant energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Action Cost:** Each inspection operation performed at $A$ or $B$ incurs an energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Capacity:** The agent is initialized with a total energy budget of $E_{max} = 8 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n3.  **Signal Interference Constraint:** Let $P = (v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ be the sequence of vertices visited by the agent. If there exists an index $i$ such that $v_i = J_2$ and $v_k \\neq A$ for all $k < i$, then the sub-path $(v_i, \\dots, A)$ leading to the first inspection of $A$ must not traverse $J_1$ if $J_1 \\in \\{v_0, \\dots, v_{i-1}\\}$. (Formally: if $J_2$ precedes the first visit to $A$ in the traversal sequence, the agent is prohibited from backtracking through $J_1$ to reach $A$ if $J_1$ was already part of the path prefix).\n\n**Objective:**\n\nIdentify the set of all valid routes that satisfy the task requirements and the signal interference constraint within the energy budget. From this set, determine the optimal path $P^*$ that minimizes the total cumulative energy expenditure $E_{total}$ upon completion of the final required inspection.\n\n**Required:**\n\n1.

The drone will launch from the designated LaunchPad with its 16-liter internal tank capacity fully available. Every action the drone takes\u2014whether it is moving through a tunnel, collecting a sample, or performing a refill\u2014is considered a single \"event,\" and the entire mission must be completed within a strict limit of 18 total events and a maximum duration of 10 minutes.\n\nThe aqueducts are one-way tunnels, and navigating them is taxing on the drone\u2019s resources. Moving through any tunnel takes exactly one minute and consumes a specific volume of the drone's tank capacity. From the LaunchPad, the drone can enter Tunnel 1, which costs 2 liters, or Tunnel 2, which costs 3 liters. Tunnel 1 leads directly to Station A, while Tunnel 2 provides access to either Station B or a specialized calibration shaft known as CalibEdge. If the drone is at Station A, it can proceed through Tunnel 3 (at a cost of 1 liter) to loop back into the entrance of Tunnel 2. If it is at the CalibEdge, it can move into Station C at a cost of 2 liters. Finally, Station C funnels back into the entrance of Tunnel 1, though this return trip is quite heavy, costing 2 liters of volume.\n\nSampling itself is a delicate process. Collecting a single sample at any station takes one minute and consumes 1 liter of the remaining tank capacity. To prevent cross-contamination, the drone is strictly prohibited from taking two samples at the same station consecutively. While the 16-liter capacity is limited, the drone can recover 3 liters of capacity by idling for two consecutive minutes at the CalibEdge; however, this refill procedure can only be performed once during the mission.\n\nThe mission's success depends on meeting specific deadlines. We are required to collect at least one sample from both Station A and Station B. The first sample at Station A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark. While Station C is an optional target, the drone is only permitted to collect a sample there if, and only if, the mandatory samples from both Station A and Station B are successfully completed within the first 8 minutes of the mission. \n\nOur primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected, including the optional one at Station C. If we can achieve the same number of samples using different routes, our secondary priority is to choose the path that completes the final mandatory sample at the earliest possible time.

The agent must execute a sequence of operations\u2014comprising movement, resource acquisition, and site sampling\u2014subject to strict temporal, resource, and logical constraints.\n\n**System Specifications**\n1.  **Graph Topology**: The vertex set $V$ consists of the following locations: $\\{\\text{LaunchPad (LP)}, \\text{Tunnel1 (T1)}, \\text{Tunnel2 (T2)}, \\text{Tunnel3 (T3)}, \\text{StationA (SA)}, \\text{StationB (SB)}, \\text{StationC (SC)}, \\text{CalibEdge (CE)}\\}$.\n2.  **Edge Definitions and Costs**: Transitions between vertices are directed and incur costs in time ($t$), events ($e$), and water ($w$). Every directed edge $(u, v)$ has a uniform time cost $\\Delta t = 1$ and event cost $\\Delta e = 1$. Water consumption $\\Delta w$ for each transition is defined as follows:\n    *   $(LP, T1): 2L$\n    *   $(LP, T2): 3L$\n    *   $(T1, SA): 1L$\n    *   $(SA, T3): 1L$\n    *   $(T3, T2): 0L$\n    *   $(T2, SB): 1L$\n    *   $(T2, CE): 2L$\n    *   $(CE, SC): 1L$\n    *   $(SC, T1): 2L$\n\n**Operational Constraints**\n*   **Initial State**: At $t=0$, the agent is at $LP$ with $w = 16L$ and $e = 0$.\n*   **Global Limits**: The mission must terminate such that total elapsed time $T \\le 10$ minutes and total accumulated events $E \\le 18$. The water level $w$ must satisfy $0 \\le w \\le 16$ at all times.\n*   **Sampling Operations**: \n    *   Sampling at a station $S_i \\in \\{SA, SB, SC\\}$ requires $\\Delta t = 1$ and $\\Delta e = 1$.\n    *   Each sampling operation yields a resource recovery of $+1L$ water.\n    *   Station $SA$ and $SB$ must be sampled exactly once.\n    *   Sampling at $SA$ must occur at $t \\le 6$.\n    *   **Conditional Constraint**: $SC$ must be sampled if and only if the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed by $t \\le 8$.\n    *   **Protocol Constraint**: Consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex are prohibited.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol**: At vertex $CE$, the agent may perform a \"Refill\" action. This action requires $\\Delta t = 2$ (consecutive) and $\\Delta e = 2$, resulting in a resource gain of $+3L$ water. This action is restricted to a single occurrence per mission.\n\n**Objective Function**\nLet $N$ be the total number of unique stations sampled. Let $T_{mandatory}$ be the time at which the sampling of both $SA$ and $SB$ is completed.\n1.  Maximize $N$.\n2.  Subject to the maximum of $N$, minimize $T_{mandatory}$.\n\n**Task**\nFormulate the optimal state-transition sequence that satisfies all aforementioned conditions.

Each workshop $w_i$ is associated with exactly one topic $t$ from the set of topics $T = \\{\\text{Data, DevOps, UI}\\}$. Let $\\tau: W \\to T$ be a function mapping workshops to topics. The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$. (Data workshops are prohibited from $r_3$).\n*   **Topic Concurrency Prohibition:** Workshops focusing on **Data** and **UI** are mutually exclusive in the temporal dimension. Formally, for any $w_i, w_j \\in W$:\n    $$\\text{if } \\tau(w_i) = \\text{Data and } \\tau(w_j) = \\text{UI, then } \\text{proj}_S(f(w_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_S(f(w_j)).$$\n\n**5. Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1. Formulate a feasible schedule $f(w)$ for all $w \\in W$.\n2. Prove that your proposed schedule satisfies the **Topic Concurrency Prohibition** and the **Room Capacity Constraints**.\n3. Determine if a valid schedule exists if the number of workshops $|W|$ were increased to seven.

The agent must execute a sampling mission subject to strict volumetric, temporal, and operational constraints.\n\n**1. Network Topology and Edge Weights:**\nThe vertex set is defined as $V = \\{v_{LP}, v_A, v_B, v_C, v_{CE}\\}$, representing the LaunchPad, Station A, Station B, Station C, and a Calibration Shaft, respectively. The directed edges $E$ and their associated volumetric costs $w(e)$ (reduction in tank capacity) are defined as follows:\n*   $e_1: (v_{LP}, v_A), w(e_1) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_2: (v_{LP}, v_B), w(e_2) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_3: (v_A, v_B), w(e_3) = 1\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_4: (v_{LP}, v_{CE}), w(e_4) = 3\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_5: (v_{CE}, v_C), w(e_5) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n*   $e_6: (v_C, v_A), w(e_6) = 2\\,\\text{L}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Agent Capabilities:**\n*   **Time ($t$):** The mission begins at $t=0$. Every traversal of an edge $e \\in E$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute.\n*   **Tank Capacity ($C$):** The agent possesses an internal reservoir with a maximum capacity $C_{max} = 16\\,\\text{L}$. The initial state is $C_0 = 16\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Sampling:** Collecting a specimen at any station $v \\in \\{v_A, v_B, v_C\\}$ consumes $\\Delta t = 1$ minute and reduces $C$ by $1\\,\\text{L}$.\n*   **Refilling:** At $v_{CE}$, the agent may perform a one-time refill operation, increasing $C$ by $3\\,\\text{L}$ (not to exceed $C_{max}$). This operation requires $\\Delta t = 2$ consecutive minutes of idling.\n*   **Event Counter ($k$):** The total sequence of discrete actions (traversals, samplings, and refills) is limited to $k \\le 18$.\n\n**3. Mission Constraints:**\nThe agent\u2019s path must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   **Mandatory Samples:** The agent must successfully perform at least one sampling operation at $v_A$ and $v_B$.\n*   **Temporal Deadlines:** The first sampling operation at $v_A$ must be completed such that $t \\le 6$.\n*   **Optional Sampling:** A sampling operation at $v_C$ is permissible **if and only if** the first instances of sampling at both $v_A$ and $v_B$ are completed within the interval $t \\in [0, 8]$.\n*   **Resource Integrity:** At no point in the mission may $C < 0$.\n*   **Cross-Contamination Protocol:** The agent is prohibited from performing two consecutive sampling operations at the same vertex.\n\n**4. Optimization Objectives:**\nFormulate a path $\\mathcal{P}$ that satisfies all constraints while optimizing the following criteria in lexicographical order:\n1.  **Maximize** the total number of samples collected $N_{total}$.\n2.  **Minimize** the completion time $t_{final}$ of the last mandatory sample ($v_A$ or $v_B$).\n\n**Required:**\na) Provide the state-space representation of the AUV.\nb) Determine if an optimal path exists that includes Station C.

The event is spread across two days, with each day broken down into three specific time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon. We have four rooms at our disposal for these sessions, but keep in mind that a room can only host one seminar during any single time slot.\n\nWhen you start mapping out the topics\u2014AI, Biology, and Math\u2014there are several departmental requirements we have to honor. The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.\n\nWe also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you\u2019ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nFinally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot.

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400.

A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT\npresentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they\ncan\u2019t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids\nAI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day \u2014 those topics\nmust not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.\nYou\u2019ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely\nrelated topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not\nexcessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the\nsame time slot, regardless of room.\nA few time-critical constraints must be obeyed. The first scheduled session on Day 1,\noccurring in the early morning, must be an AI presentation \u2014 no other topic is\npermitted to occupy that slot. At the other end of the schedule, the early afternoon\nsession on Day 4 must be reserved exclusively for VR; no other topic may take that\nposition.\nTo ensure consistent coverage and audience engagement, each day must include at least\none presentation, even if others remain unassigned. And each time slot, across all\nrooms, should exhibit at least two different topics \u2014 no slot should be monopolized\nby a single subject area.\nFinally, when multiple valid schedules satisfy all the constraints, preference should\nbe given to those that maximize the number of rooms in use during each session.\nOnce that\u2019s achieved, the next priority is to minimize idle room-time slots overall,\nwithout violating any rule that would otherwise disqualify a more efficient layout."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 presentations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(P, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each presentation must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : room(R), slot(Sl), day(D) } :- presentation(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one presentation per room\u2011time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, Sl, D), scheduled(P2, R, Sl, D), P1 != P2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most three times per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(P, R, Sl, D) : presentation(P), slot(Sl) } 3 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, R, Sl1, D), scheduled(_, R, Sl2, D), Sl1 = Sl2 - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"AI\", -projector(R).\n:- scheduled(P, R, _, _), topicOf(P, T), T = \"Cloud\", -projector(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR cannot be in room 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, 1, _, _), topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(D) :- scheduled(P, _, _, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { D : hasIoT(D) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P1, R, _, D), scheduled(P2, R, _, D),\ntopicOf(P1, \"VR\"), topicOf(P2, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, \"IoT\").\n:- day(D), slot(S), #count { P : cloudOrIoT(P, Sl, D) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(P, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(P, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(P, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each day must have at least one presentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), not scheduled(_, _, _, D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(T, Sl, D) :- scheduled(P, _, Sl, D), topicOf(P, T).\n:- slot(Sl), day(D), #count { T : hasTopic(T, Sl, D) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, Sl, D) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl, D).\nroomsUsed(N, Sl, D) :- N = #count { R : used(R, Sl, D) }, slot(Sl), day(D).\n#maximize { N@2 : roomsUsed(N, Sl, D) }.\nidle(R, Sl, D) :- room(R), slot(Sl), day(D), not used(R, Sl, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, Sl, D: idle(R, Sl, D) }.\n#minimize { N@1: num_idle(N) }."}]}

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize \"wasted\" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAs our autonomous rover prepares to navigate the subterranean tunnel network of the Mars base, we need to carefully map out its trajectory from the LaunchPad. The rover begins its mission with a full 16-liter tank of water, which is vital for both hydraulic drilling and thermal cooling. We have a total of 10 minutes to complete the mission, and the mission controller has capped the rover at 18 total events\u2014counting every movement, sampling operation, and water refill\u2014to prevent excessive wear on the hardware.\n\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover has two primary paths. It can enter Tunnel1, which consumes 2 liters of water, leading directly toward StationA. Reaching StationA itself requires an additional 1 liter to manage the station's specific climate. Once the rover finishes at StationA, it can transition to Tunnel2 by passing through Tunnel3 at a cost of 1 liter. Alternatively, the rover can head straight from the LaunchPad into Tunnel2 for a 3-liter cost. Tunnel2 serves as a hub, branching off to either StationB, which costs 1 liter to access, or the CalibEdge location, which costs 2 liters. From CalibEdge, there is a path to StationC for 1 liter, and StationC offers a return route back to Tunnel1 at a cost of 2 liters.\n\nThe mission requires the rover to collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once. Timing is critical for StationA, as its samples degrade and must be collected no later than the 6-minute mark. While StationC is a secondary site, the mission parameters are strict: the rover must collect a sample there if and only if both StationA and StationB have been successfully sampled within the first 8 minutes of the mission. Each sampling operation takes exactly one minute of stationary time, during which the rover's filtration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the substrate. To prevent cross-contamination, the rover is prohibited from taking two consecutive samples at the same station.\n\nIf the water supply runs low, the rover can utilize an emergency reservoir at CalibEdge. By remaining at CalibEdge for two consecutive minutes, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water. However, due to facility lockdown protocols, this reservoir can only be accessed once.\n\nEvery movement between connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover must always follow the designated directions of the tunnel system. Our ultimate goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected. In the event that multiple routes yield the same number of samples, we will prioritize the plan that completes the mandatory sampling at StationA and StationB in the shortest amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Event Limit: \u2264 18 events (moves + samples + refill)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB (exactly once each)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Tank Capacity: 16\u202fL."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling: 1\u202fmin, +1\u202fL per sample."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Refill at CalibEdge: 2 min \u2192 +3L, at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Secondary: minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationA must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Primary: maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start at launchpad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement: 1\u202fmin per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}]}

The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are preparing to deploy a water-sampling drone into the subterranean aqueduct network, and there are several operational parameters you need to keep in mind for this mission. The drone will launch from the designated LaunchPad with its 16-liter internal tank capacity fully available. Every action the drone takes\u2014whether it is moving through a tunnel, collecting a sample, or performing a refill\u2014is considered a single \"event,\" and the entire mission must be completed within a strict limit of 18 total events and a maximum duration of 10 minutes.\n\nThe aqueducts are one-way tunnels, and navigating them is taxing on the drone\u2019s resources. Moving through any tunnel takes exactly one minute and consumes a specific volume of the drone's tank capacity. From the LaunchPad, the drone can enter Tunnel 1, which costs 2 liters, or Tunnel 2, which costs 3 liters. Tunnel 1 leads directly to Station A, while Tunnel 2 provides access to either Station B or a specialized calibration shaft known as CalibEdge. If the drone is at Station A, it can proceed through Tunnel 3 (at a cost of 1 liter) to loop back into the entrance of Tunnel 2. If it is at the CalibEdge, it can move into Station C at a cost of 2 liters. Finally, Station C funnels back into the entrance of Tunnel 1, though this return trip is quite heavy, costing 2 liters of volume.\n\nSampling itself is a delicate process. Collecting a single sample at any station takes one minute and consumes 1 liter of the remaining tank capacity. To prevent cross-contamination, the drone is strictly prohibited from taking two samples at the same station consecutively. While the 16-liter capacity is limited, the drone can recover 3 liters of capacity by idling for two consecutive minutes at the CalibEdge; however, this refill procedure can only be performed once during the mission.\n\nThe mission's success depends on meeting specific deadlines. We are required to collect at least one sample from both Station A and Station B. The first sample at Station A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark. While Station C is an optional target, the drone is only permitted to collect a sample there if, and only if, the mandatory samples from both Station A and Station B are successfully completed within the first 8 minutes of the mission. \n\nOur primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples collected, including the optional one at Station C. If we can achieve the same number of samples using different routes, our secondary priority is to choose the path that completes the final mandatory sample at the earliest possible time.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey there, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for that upcoming event we\u2019re planning. We have six workshops in total that need to be slotted into a single day, and they\u2019re divided among three main topics: Data, DevOps, and User Interface. The venue has given us three rooms to work with, and the day itself is split into three distinct time blocks\u2014the morning, midday, and afternoon sessions.\n\nAs we put this together, we have to make sure every one of those six workshops is assigned to a specific room and a specific time slot. However, the venue has a strict policy that no single room can host more than two sessions over the course of the day. Of course, this also means we can\u2019t have two different workshops occupying the same room at the same time.\n\nThe content of the workshops adds another layer of complexity to the schedule. The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.\n\nTo make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics\u2014Data, DevOps, and UI\u2014is represented at least once on the final schedule. Finally, as we piece this puzzle together, our goal is to be as efficient as possible with the venue's space. We want to minimize any unused room-time slots, making the most of our booking while staying strictly within all these logistical boundaries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 6 workshops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..6)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: workshops are in data devops or ui"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"Data\"; \"DevOps\"; \"UI\").\n1 { topicOf(W, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there is 1 day with 3 time slots morning midday afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "slot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 3 rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each workshop must be scheduled"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(W, R, Sl) : room(R), slot(Sl) } :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only one workshop per room\u2011time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, Sl), scheduled(W2, R, Sl), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each room can be used at most twice"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(W, R, Sl) : workshop(W), slot(Sl) } 2 :- room(R)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: devops workshops only in midday"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, Sl), topicOf(W, \"DevOps\"), Sl != \"midday\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: data workshops cannot be in room 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, 3, _), topicOf(W, \"Data\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ui and data cannot be scheduled at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, _, Sl), scheduled(W2, _, Sl),\ntopicOf(W1, \"UI\"), topicOf(W2, \"Data\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: at least one workshop of each topic must occur"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "occurs(T) :- scheduled(W, _, _), topicOf(W, T).\n:- topic(T), not occurs(T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: try to minimize idle room slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, Sl) :- scheduled(_, R, Sl).\nidle(R, Sl) :- room(R), slot(Sl), not used(R, Sl).\n#minimize { 1, R, Sl : idle(R, Sl) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of coordinating a series of eight graduate workshops scheduled over the course of two days. Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible. While we must strictly adhere to all these rules, we want to minimize the number of unused room-time slots across the two-day period."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 8 graduate workshops."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Workshops are in AI, Math, or Bio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Math\"; \"Bio\").\n1 {topicOf(Math, V13) : topic(V13)} 1 :- workshop(Math)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 2 days, with 3 time slots per day: morning, midday, and afternoon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..2).\nslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 3 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each workshop must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 {scheduled(A, First, Room, D) : room(First), slot(Room), day(D)} :- workshop(A)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one workshop can be in a room at a time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(V16, G, F, V13), scheduled(Mathematics, G, F, V13), V16 != Mathematics."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most twice per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{scheduled(Y, V19, K, Mathematics) : workshop(Y), slot(K)} 2 :- room(V19), day(Mathematics)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 is not available in the afternoon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 2, \"afternoon\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI workshops must be in the morning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Additionally, _, Z, _), topicOf(Additionally, \"AI\"), Z != \"morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No two Math workshops can be scheduled at the same time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(J, _, V, V10), scheduled(V8, _, V, V10), topicOf(J, \"Math\"), topicOf(V8, \"Math\"), J != V8."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bio and AI cannot be in the same room on the same day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(F, V14, _, Z), scheduled(N, V14, _, Z), topicOf(F, \"Bio\"), topicOf(N, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least one workshop of each topic must be held on each day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(V10), topic(S), not scheduled(V18, _, _, V10) : topicOf(V18, S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Try to minimize idle room slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(V12, K, W) :- scheduled(_, V12, K, W).\nidle(V12, K, W) :- room(V12), slot(K), day(W), not used(V12, K, W).\n#minimize {1, V12, K, W : idle(V12, K, W)}."}]}

The selection process is subject to a set of compatibility constraints defined by the following logical implications:\n\n1.  **Speaker-Amplifier Dependency:** The selection of $s_1$ necessitates the selection of $a_1$ ($s = s_1 \\implies a = a_1$).\n2.  **Amplifier-Player Mutual Exclusion:** The selection of $a_2$ precludes the selection of $m_1$ ($a = a_2 \\implies m \\neq m_1$).\n3.  **Player-Speaker Dependency:** The selection of $m_2$ is conditionally dependent on the selection of $s_2$ ($m = m_2 \\implies s = s_2$).\n\n**Problem:** \nFormally identify a configuration $(s, a, m)$ that satisfies the conjunction of the aforementioned constraints.

Each workshop $w_i$ is associated with exactly one topic $t$ from the set of topics $T = \\{\\text{Data, DevOps, UI}\\}$. Let $\\tau: W \\to T$ be a function mapping workshops to topics. The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$. (Data workshops are prohibited from $r_3$).\n*   **Topic Concurrency Prohibition:** Workshops focusing on **Data** and **UI** are mutually exclusive in the temporal dimension. Formally, for any $w_i, w_j \\in W$:\n    $$\\text{if } \\tau(w_i) = \\text{Data and } \\tau(w_j) = \\text{UI, then } \\text{proj}_S(f(w_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_S(f(w_j)).$$\n\n**5. Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1. Formulate a feasible schedule $f(w)$ for all $w \\in W$.\n2. Prove that your proposed schedule satisfies the **Topic Concurrency Prohibition** and the **Room Capacity Constraints**.\n3.

Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize \"wasted\" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

We have six workshops in total that need to be slotted into a single day, and they\u2019re divided among three main topics: Data, DevOps, and User Interface. The venue has given us three rooms to work with, and the day itself is split into three distinct time blocks\u2014the morning, midday, and afternoon sessions.\n\nAs we put this together, we have to make sure every one of those six workshops is assigned to a specific room and a specific time slot. However, the venue has a strict policy that no single room can host more than two sessions over the course of the day. Of course, this also means we can\u2019t have two different workshops occupying the same room at the same time.\n\nThe content of the workshops adds another layer of complexity to the schedule. The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.\n\nTo make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics\u2014Data, DevOps, and UI\u2014is represented at least once on the final schedule.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Resource Allocation and Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement**\nA technical symposium requires the scheduling of a set of ten presentations, denoted by $P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{10}\\}$. Each presentation $p_i$ is associated with exactly one domain $k$ from the set $K = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (C), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR)}\\}$. \n\nThe event occurs over a temporal horizon of four days, $D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with each day partitioned into four discrete, sequential sessions: $S = \\{\\text{early morning}, \\text{late morning}, \\text{early afternoon}, \\text{late afternoon}\\}$. Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4. Boundary Conditions\n*   **Initialization:** The session $(d=1, s=\\text{early morning})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{AI\\}$ domain.\n*   **Termination:** The session $(d=4, s=\\text{early afternoon})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{VR\\}$ domain.\n\n### 5. Optimization Objectives\nIn the event that multiple feasible schedules exist, the optimal schedule shall be determined by the following lexicographical preference order:\n1.  **Maximize Spatial Parallelism:** Maximize the number of rooms utilized during each active session $(d, s)$.\n2.  **Maximize Efficiency:** Minimize the total number of idle (unassigned) room-time slots across the global schedule, subject to the preservation of all primary constraints.\n\n**Task:**\nFormalize the above as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Provide a valid assignment of $P$ to the domain $D \\times S \\times R$ that satisfies all conditions, or prove that no such assignment exists given the strictness of the non-contiguity and diversity constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 presentations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(Objectives, V) : topic(V) } 1 :- presentation(Objectives)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each presentation must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(E, Unique, Five, V3) : room(Unique), slot(Five), day(V3) } :- presentation(E)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one presentation per room\u2011time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Distribution, V19, Temporal, V2), scheduled(Internet, V19, Temporal, V2), Distribution != Internet."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most three times per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(Concurrency, Concurrency, Things, V10) : presentation(Concurrency), slot(Things) } 3 :- room(Concurrency), day(V10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, Topical, Exclusion, G), scheduled(_, Topical, Problem, G), Exclusion = Problem - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(Objectives, Constrained, _, _), topicOf(Objectives, Occupancy), Occupancy = \"AI\", -projector(Constrained).\n:- scheduled(Objectives, Constrained, _, _), topicOf(Objectives, Occupancy), Occupancy = \"Cloud\", -projector(Constrained)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR cannot be in room 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Unique, 1, _, _), topicOf(Unique, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(Z) :- scheduled(V18, _, _, Z), topicOf(V18, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { Z : hasIoT(Z) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Y, V6, _, J), scheduled(Contiguity, V6, _, J),\ntopicOf(Y, \"VR\"), topicOf(Contiguity, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(V19, B, Maximize) :- scheduled(V19, _, B, Maximize), topicOf(V19, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(V19, B, Maximize) :- scheduled(V19, _, B, Maximize), topicOf(V19, \"IoT\").\n:- day(Maximize), slot(V18), #count { V19 : cloudOrIoT(V19, B, Maximize) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Consequently, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(Consequently, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Maximize, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(Maximize, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each day must have at least one presentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(F), not scheduled(_, _, _, F)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(Objectives, Consequently, Task) :- scheduled(Z, _, Consequently, Task), topicOf(Z, Objectives).\n:- slot(Consequently), day(Task), #count { Objectives : hasTopic(Objectives, Consequently, Task) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(Exclusion, Statement, V2) :- scheduled(_, Exclusion, Statement, V2).\nroomsUsed(Presentations, Statement, V2) :- Presentations = #count { Exclusion : used(Exclusion, Statement, V2) }, slot(Statement), day(V2).\n#maximize { Presentations@2 : roomsUsed(Presentations, Statement, V2) }.\nidle(Exclusion, Statement, V2) :- room(Exclusion), slot(Statement), day(V2), not used(Exclusion, Statement, V2).\nnum_idle(Presentations) :- Presentations = #count{Exclusion, Statement, V2: idle(Exclusion, Statement, V2) }.\n#minimize { Presentations@1: num_idle(Presentations) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nA logistical framework is required to coordinate a four-day symposium featuring ten distinct lectures. These presentations are categorized into four specialized tracks: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Cloud Computing (CC)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Virtual Reality (VR)**. \n\nThe itinerary consists of four daily cycles, each divided into four specific time blocks: Early Morning, Late Morning, Early Afternoon, and Late Afternoon. To facilitate these sessions, five separate auditoriums are available.\n\n### Foundational Protocols\n1.  **Exhaustive Scheduling:** Every one of the ten lectures must be assigned a slot; none may be excluded.\n2.  **Unique Occupancy:** A specific auditorium at a specific time block can host exactly one lecture.\n3.  **Daily Venue Capacity:** No single auditorium may host more than three lectures within a single day.\n4.  **Temporal Buffering:** Auditoriums cannot be used for back-to-back sessions. If a room is occupied during one time block, it must remain vacant during the immediately following block on that same day.\n\n### Spatial and Technical Restrictions\n*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Auditorium 2 is not equipped with the necessary projection hardware for AI or Cloud Computing sessions; therefore, these tracks are prohibited in this venue.\n*   **Exclusion Zones:** Virtual Reality sessions are strictly forbidden from taking place in Auditorium 1 at any time.\n\n### Categorical and Concurrent Rules\n*   **IoT Distribution:** To ensure broad exposure, IoT lectures must be staged across a minimum of three different days.\n*   **Incompatibility Clause:** AI and VR sessions are mutually exclusive regarding physical space on a daily basis. They cannot be scheduled in the same auditorium on the same day, regardless of the time blocks used.\n*   **Concurrency Ceiling:** While Cloud Computing and IoT sessions may occur simultaneously, their combined presence is limited: no more than two total sessions from these two tracks (combined) may be active across all auditoriums during any single time block.\n\n### Fixed Itinerary Anchors\n*   **Inaugural Session:** The very first slot of the event (Day 1, Early Morning) is reserved exclusively for an AI presentation.\n*   **Closing Phase Constraint:** The Early Afternoon slot on the final day (Day 4) is reserved exclusively for a VR presentation.\n\n### Operational Diversity and Efficiency\n*   **Daily Minimum:** At least one presentation must occur on each of the four days.\n*   **Thematic Variety:** Every active time block must exhibit diversity; no single track can be the only subject matter presented during a specific time slot across the various auditoriums.

The probe must conclude its mission within a 10-minute operational window.\n\n**Navigation and Resource Costs:**\nThe cavern is structured as a network of sectors and waypoints. Fluid consumption varies based on the thermal intensity of the path:\n*   **From Deployment Hub:** The probe can enter either Sector-Alpha (2 units) or Sector-Beta (3 units).\n*   **Sector-Alpha:** Leads to Waypoint-A (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-A:** Following data retrieval, the probe can move through a bypass (1 unit) to reach Sector-Beta.\n*   **Sector-Beta:** This hub branches to either Waypoint-B (1 unit) or the Calibration-Sump (2 units).\n*   **Calibration-Sump:** This location leads to Waypoint-C (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-C:** Offers a return path to Sector-Alpha (2 units).\n\n**Data Collection Protocols:**\n*   **Mandatory Sites:** The probe is required to secure one data sample from Waypoint-A and one from Waypoint-B. \n*   **Waypoint-A Deadline:** Due to atmospheric instability, the sample at Waypoint-A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n*   **Waypoint-C (Conditional):** Retrieval at Waypoint-C is required if, and only if, the primary samples (A and B) are both secured within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n*   **Extraction Mechanics:** Each sampling operation takes 1 minute to complete. During this time, the probe\u2019s recycling system recovers 1 unit of thermal fluid from the environment. To prevent sensor fouling, the probe cannot perform two extraction operations consecutively at the same waypoint.\n\n**Maintenance and Limitations:**\n*   **The Calibration-Sump:** This site contains a unique recharge port. If the probe remains stationary here for 2 consecutive minutes, it replenishes 3 units of thermal fluid. This recharge can be performed only once before the port seals.\n*   **Mobility:** Every relocation between any two connected nodes takes exactly 1 minute. The probe must follow the established directional flow of the network.\n*   **Action Cap:** To prevent mechanical fatigue, the probe is limited to a maximum of 18 total discrete actions (moves, extractions, or recharges).\n\n**Mission Optimization:**\nThe primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples retrieved.

The DevOps sessions are quite restricted; they can only take place during the midday slot, with no exceptions for the morning or afternoon. The Data workshops have their own set of needs as well, specifically that they cannot be held in Room 3 under any circumstances, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, we have to manage the flow of attendees by ensuring that UI and Data workshops never run concurrently. If a Data workshop is happening in one room, we cannot have a UI workshop running in a different room during that same time period.\n\nTo make sure the day is well-rounded for our guests, we need to ensure that each of the three topics\u2014Data, DevOps, and UI\u2014is represented at least once on the final schedule.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Resource Allocation in Multi-Track Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Description**\nConsider a set of six distinct entities representing workshops, denoted by $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_6\\}$. Each workshop $w_i$ is associated with exactly one topic $t$ from the set of topics $T = \\{\\text{Data, DevOps, UI}\\}$. Let $\\tau: W \\to T$ be a function mapping workshops to topics. The scheduling environment consists of a set of discrete time slots $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) and a set of available venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe objective is to define a schedule mapping $f: W \\to S \\times R$ that assigns each workshop to a unique time-room pair $(s, r)$, subject to the following constraints:\n\n**1. Workshop Existence and Uniqueness**\nEach workshop $w \\in W$ must be assigned to exactly one time slot and one room. No two workshops may occupy the same room during the same time slot; that is, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n**2. Topic Coverage (Surjectivity)**\nThe schedule must ensure representation from all topic areas. The mapping $\\tau$ must satisfy the condition that the image $\\tau(W) = T$. Specifically, there must exist at least one $w \\in W$ for each $t \\in T$.\n\n**3. Room Capacity Constraints**\nThe total number of workshops assigned to any single room $r \\in R$ over the duration of all time slots $S$ is limited by a maximum cardinality. Formally:\n$$\\forall r \\in R, |\\{w \\in W \\mid \\text{proj}_R(f(w)) = r\\}| \\leq 2$$\nwhere $\\text{proj}_R$ denotes the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms.\n\n**4. Domain-Specific Temporal and Spatial Restrictions**\nThe mapping $f$ is subject to the following logical predicates:\n*   **DevOps Temporal Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{DevOps}$, then $\\text{proj}_S(f(w)) = s_2$ (Midday).\n*   **Data Spatial Constraint:** If $\\tau(w) = \\text{Data}$, then $\\text{proj}_R(f(w)) \\in \\{r_1, r_2\\}$. (Data workshops are prohibited from $r_3$).\n*   **Topic Concurrency Prohibition:** Workshops focusing on **Data** and **UI** are mutually exclusive in the temporal dimension. Formally, for any $w_i, w_j \\in W$:\n    $$\\text{if } \\tau(w_i) = \\text{Data and } \\tau(w_j) = \\text{UI, then } \\text{proj}_S(f(w_i)) \\neq \\text{proj}_S(f(w_j)).$$\n\n**5. Optimization Objective**\nWhile satisfying the above feasibility conditions, the schedule must maximize the utilization of the available spatio-temporal resources. Define the utilization $U$ as the ratio of occupied slots to total available slots $|S \\times R|$. Given that $|W|=6$ and $|S \\times R|=9$, provide a configuration that minimizes the count of null assignments (empty room-slots) while maintaining strict adherence to the constraints.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

Additionally, you can\u2019t mix a Bio session with a Chem\nsession under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.\nThere\u2019s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close\nwith mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both\nmathematics events. Beyond that, you\u2019ll want to avoid empty slots\nunless there\u2019s simply no alternative.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nHey, I wanted to walk you through the logistics for organizing our upcoming four-day symposium. We have ten presentations to fit into the schedule, covering four specific domains: Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality. The event runs for four days, and we\u2019re sticking to a standard four-session structure each day: early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon. We have five rooms available to us throughout the venue, but there are quite a few moving parts we need to keep track of to make this work.\n\nFirst off, every single one of those ten presentations must be assigned a slot; we can\u2019t leave any out. Each room-time pairing can only host one presentation at a time, but we also have to be careful about how we use the physical space. A room can\u2019t host more than three presentations in a single day, and we have a strict rule against back-to-back sessions in the same room. This means if you schedule a talk in a room for the early morning, that room has to remain empty during the late morning before it can be used again. This \"non-consecutive\" rule applies to all rooms across the entire event to prevent any one space from becoming too crowded or overworked.\n\nThere are also some hardware and location-specific restrictions. Room 2 doesn\u2019t have a projector, so it\u2019s off-limits for AI and Cloud Computing sessions, as those speakers definitely need visual aids. Additionally, Room 1 cannot be used for any VR presentations at any point during the four days.\n\nWhen it comes to the topics themselves, we need to ensure they are spread out appropriately. IoT presentations shouldn\u2019t be bunched together; they need to be distributed so that they appear on at least three different days. We also have a spatial rule regarding AI and VR: they can never share the same room on the same day. Even if they are scheduled for different time slots, if an AI talk happens in Room 3 on Tuesday, no VR talk can be in Room 3 that same day. \n\nRegarding simultaneous sessions, we need to monitor the overlap between Cloud and IoT. While they can happen at the same time, we have to limit the density\u2014no more than two presentations from those two fields combined can occur during any single time slot, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nThere are two \"anchor\" sessions we\u2019ve already promised. The very first session of the event\u2014early morning on Day 1\u2014must be an AI presentation. No other topic can take that opening spot. Similarly, the early afternoon session on Day 4 is reserved strictly for VR. \n\nTo keep the momentum going, every day of the symposium must have at least one presentation scheduled. Furthermore, we want to ensure variety for our attendees; in any given time slot where multiple rooms are active, there must be at least two different topics represented. We don't want any single time slot to be a \"monopoly\" for just one subject area.\n\nAs you piece the final schedule together, keep our efficiency goals in mind. If you find multiple ways to satisfy all these rules, our first priority is to maximize the number of rooms in use during each session to give the event a high-energy feel. After that, we want to minimize the total number of idle room-time slots across the four days, provided it doesn't conflict with any of the other requirements.

Each seminar pertains to one of three specific disciplines: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mathematics, or Biology. \n\nThe schedule for both days is partitioned into three distinct periods: Morning, Midday, and Afternoon. You have three available venues (Rooms 1, 2, and 3) to host these sessions. Every one of the eight seminars must be assigned a unique combination of room, day, and time slot.\n\nTo ensure proper management, the following logistical parameters must be strictly observed:\n\n**Facility Constraints:**\n*   **Occupancy Limits:** No more than two seminars may be hosted in any single room during a given day. Consequently, every room must remain vacant for at least one of its three time slots daily.\n*   **Concurrent Use:** Only one seminar can occupy a specific room at any given time.\n*   **Room 2 Restriction:** Room 2 is strictly off-limits during the Afternoon period on both Day 1 and Day 2.\n\n**Disciplinary Constraints:**\n*   **AI Scheduling:** All AI-related seminars are restricted to the Morning time slot. They are prohibited during Midday or Afternoon periods.\n*   **Math Scheduling:** Mathematics seminars are subject to a non-concurrency rule. No two Math sessions may occur simultaneously, regardless of which rooms are being used.\n*   **Inter-Subject Compatibility:** AI and Biology sessions are mutually exclusive within a single room-day pair. If a room hosts an AI seminar on a particular day, it cannot host a Biology seminar on that same day, and vice versa.\n*   **Curriculum Balance:** Every day\u2019s agenda must be comprehensive, featuring at least one seminar from each of the three disciplines (AI, Math, and Biology).\n\n**Optimization Goal:**\nWhile several configurations may satisfy these rules, you should prioritize \"high-density\" scheduling.

It departs from the Deployment Hub with a pressurized reservoir containing 16 units of thermal fluid, which is consumed during navigation and drilling. The probe must conclude its mission within a 10-minute operational window.\n\n**Navigation and Resource Costs:**\nThe cavern is structured as a network of sectors and waypoints. Fluid consumption varies based on the thermal intensity of the path:\n*   **From Deployment Hub:** The probe can enter either Sector-Alpha (2 units) or Sector-Beta (3 units).\n*   **Sector-Alpha:** Leads to Waypoint-A (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-A:** Following data retrieval, the probe can move through a bypass (1 unit) to reach Sector-Beta.\n*   **Sector-Beta:** This hub branches to either Waypoint-B (1 unit) or the Calibration-Sump (2 units).\n*   **Calibration-Sump:** This location leads to Waypoint-C (1 unit).\n*   **Waypoint-C:** Offers a return path to Sector-Alpha (2 units).\n\n**Data Collection Protocols:**\n*   **Mandatory Sites:** The probe is required to secure one data sample from Waypoint-A and one from Waypoint-B. \n*   **Waypoint-A Deadline:** Due to atmospheric instability, the sample at Waypoint-A must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n*   **Waypoint-C (Conditional):** Retrieval at Waypoint-C is required if, and only if, the primary samples (A and B) are both secured within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n*   **Extraction Mechanics:** Each sampling operation takes 1 minute to complete. During this time, the probe\u2019s recycling system recovers 1 unit of thermal fluid from the environment. To prevent sensor fouling, the probe cannot perform two extraction operations consecutively at the same waypoint.\n\n**Maintenance and Limitations:**\n*   **The Calibration-Sump:** This site contains a unique recharge port. If the probe remains stationary here for 2 consecutive minutes, it replenishes 3 units of thermal fluid. This recharge can be performed only once before the port seals.\n*   **Mobility:** Every relocation between any two connected nodes takes exactly 1 minute. The probe must follow the established directional flow of the network.\n*   **Action Cap:** To prevent mechanical fatigue, the probe is limited to a maximum of 18 total discrete actions (moves, extractions, or recharges).\n\n**Mission Optimization:**\nThe primary goal is to maximize the total number of samples retrieved.

The event is hosted in a venue with four rooms, and each day is structured into three distinct sessions consisting of a morning, a midday, and an evening slot. Every workshop needs to be assigned its own room and time, as we cannot allow for any double-bookings.\n\nAs we coordinate the space, we have to follow several logistical constraints to ensure the event runs smoothly. No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.\n\nThematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.\n\nTo keep the daily schedule organized, we\u2019ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won\u2019t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.\n\nOur objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules.

Arterial Path 2 (3-unit cost) leads toward Site Beta or a Calibration Shaft.\n*   **From Site Alpha:** The probe can take Connector 3 (1-unit cost) to merge into Arterial Path 2.\n*   **From Arterial Path 2:** The probe may proceed to Site Beta (1-unit access cost) or enter the Calibration Shaft (2-unit access cost).\n*   **From Calibration Shaft:** Entry is permitted into Site Gamma (1-unit access cost).\n*   **From Site Gamma:** A return flow allows the probe to re-enter Arterial Path 1 at a cost of 2 units.\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n1.  **Temporal & Volumetric Limits:** The probe begins at T-0 with 16 units. It must conclude all operations within a 10-minute window. It cannot exceed its 16-unit storage limit at any time.\n2.  **Maintenance Protocol:** While at the Calibration Shaft, the probe may remain idle for 2 consecutive minutes to recover 3 units of capacity. This recharge protocol is restricted to a single occurrence.\n3.  **Mission Requirements:** Samples from Site Alpha and Site Beta are compulsory. The Alpha specimen must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n4.  **Conditional Objective:** Sampling Site Gamma is mandatory if, and only if, the two compulsory samples (Alpha and Beta) are successfully collected within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n5.  **Event Cap:** The cumulative total of all discrete actions\u2014movements, sampling procedures, and recharge idles\u2014is strictly capped at 18 events.\n6.  **Purity Protocol:** To prevent cross-contamination, the probe is prohibited from performing back-to-back sampling actions at the same location.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n*   **Primary Priority:** Maximize the total quantity of specimens collected (Compulsory + Optional).\n*   **Secondary Priority:** Minimize the timestamp at which the final compulsory sample is obtained."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Locations: HubWest, NodeA, NodeB, Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"HubWest\"; \"NodeA\"; \"NodeB\"; \"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Edges: (HubWest\u2013NodeA), (HubWest\u2013NodeB), (NodeA\u2013Sensor1), (NodeB\u2013Sensor2), (NodeA\u2013NodeB)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeA\").\nedge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeB\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"Sensor1\").\nedge(\"NodeB\", \"Sensor2\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"NodeB\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Max duration: 9 minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..9)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start location: HubWest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"HubWest\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes costs 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling targets: Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "inspect(\"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each sample requires a full minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(L, T) : time(T) } 1 :- inspect(L).\nat(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize time by which both samples are completed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "latest_inspect(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(_, T1) }.\n#minimize { T : latest_inspect(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: A minimum of three timesteps between samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- inspect_at(_, T1), inspect_at(_, T2), 0 < T1 - T2 < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If NodeB is visited before Sensor1, then NodeA may not be visited afterward"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeB\", T1), at(\"Sensor1\", T2), at(\"NodeA\", T3), T1 < T2 < T3."}]}

Each of these workshops focuses on one of three specific subjects: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or Biology. To get this organized, we have three rooms at our disposal, and each day is broken down into three distinct time slots: the morning, midday, and afternoon. Every one of the eight workshops must be assigned to a specific room and time slot on one of the two days.\n\nThere are several logistical constraints we have to keep in mind regarding the rooms. First, it is impossible for two workshops to occupy the same room at the same time. Additionally, each room is restricted to a maximum of two workshops per day, which means that in every room, at least one of the three time slots must remain empty each day. We also have a specific issue with Room 2, as it is completely unavailable during the afternoon on both days, so we cannot schedule anything there during those times.\n\nThe subjects themselves also dictate how we build the schedule. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions; they cannot be placed in the midday or afternoon slots. When it comes to the Mathematics workshops, we have to ensure that no two sessions occur simultaneously, meaning we cannot have Math workshops overlapping even if they are in different rooms. Furthermore, we have a room-sharing restriction between Artificial Intelligence and Biology. If an AI workshop is held in a particular room on a given day, no Biology workshop can be held in that same room at any point during that same day, and vice versa.\n\nTo ensure that the academic coverage is balanced for our attendees, each day of the event must include at least one workshop from each of the three topics. This means every day has to feature at least one AI, one Math, and one Biology session. As we finalize the schedule, our goal is to use the available space as efficiently as possible.

Context and System Definition**\nConsider an autonomous agent $\\mathcal{A}$ (a maintenance rover) operating within a discrete topological space represented by an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The vertex set $V$ represents physical locations, and the edge set $E$ represents traversable paths of unit distance.\n\nThe vertex set is defined as:\n$V = \\{v_{BC}, v_{F1}, v_{F2}, v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$\nwhere:\n*   $v_{BC}$: BaseCamp (Initial State)\n*   $v_{F1}, v_{F2}$: Intermediate Junctions (Fork1, Fork2)\n*   $v_{OX}, v_{OY}$: Mandatory Inspection Targets (OutpostX, OutpostY)\n*   $v_{RS}$: Optional Diagnostic Node (RelayStation)\n\nThe adjacency relations are defined by the set $E$:\n$E = \\{(v_{BC}, v_{F1}), (v_{BC}, v_{F2}), (v_{F1}, v_{OX}), (v_{F1}, v_{RS}), (v_{F2}, v_{OY}), (v_{F2}, v_{RS})\\}$\n\n**2. State Variables and Constraints**\nThe agent is subject to two primary resource constraints: Temporal ($T$) and Energetic ($B$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** At $t=0$, the agent is positioned at $v_{BC}$ with an initial battery capacity $B_0 = 6$ units and elapsed time $T_0 = 0$ minutes.\n*   **Temporal Costs:** \n    *   Movement between any two adjacent vertices $v_i, v_j \\in V$ incurs a cost $\\Delta T_{move} = 1$ minute.\n    *   The inspection process at any node $v \\in \\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}, v_{RS}\\}$ requires a stationary duration of $\\Delta T_{inspect} = 1$ minute.\n*   **Energy Costs:** Each movement action consumes $\\Delta B = 1$ unit of battery. Stationary inspections do not deplete battery resources.\n*   **Global Bounds:** The total elapsed time must satisfy $T_{final} \\le 10$. The battery level must satisfy $B_t \\ge 0$ for all $t$.\n\n**3. Objectives and Task Requirements**\nThe agent must execute a path $P$ that satisfies the following conditions:\n1.  **Mandatory Coverage:** The set of visited and inspected nodes must include $\\{v_{OX}, v_{OY}\\}$. Each mandatory node must be inspected exactly once.\n2.  **Optional Reward Condition:** The agent may optionally inspect $v_{RS}$. Let $t_{req}$ be the timestamp at which the second of the two mandatory inspections ($v_{OX}, v_{OY}$) is completed. A diagnostic reward is granted for inspecting $v_{RS}$ if and only if $B_{t_{req}} > 2$.\n\n**4. Problem Statement**\nFormalize the agent's movement as a sequence of states. Determine the feasibility of completing all mandatory inspections while maximizing the diagnostic reward. \n\n**Tasks:**\n*   (a) Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree representing the possible trajectories of the rover.\n*   (b) Identify if there exists a valid path $P$ such that $v_{RS}$ is inspected and the diagnostic reward condition ($B_{t_{req}} > 2$) is satisfied within the global temporal bound $T \\le 10$.\n*   (c) If such a path exists, provide the sequence of vertices and actions (Move/Inspect). If not, provide a formal proof of infeasibility based on the energy constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: locations basecamp fork1 fork2 outpostx outposty relaystation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"BaseCamp\"; \"Fork1\"; \"Fork2\"; \"OutpostX\"; \"OutpostY\"; \"RelayStation\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: edges"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"BaseCamp\", \"Fork1\").\nedge(\"BaseCamp\", \"Fork2\").\nedge(\"Fork1\", \"OutpostX\").\nedge(\"Fork1\", \"RelayStation\").\nedge(\"Fork2\", \"OutpostY\").\nedge(\"Fork2\", \"RelayStation\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the rover starts at basecamp"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"BaseCamp\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: inspect outpostx and outposty exactly once each"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(\"OutpostX\", T) : time(T) } 1.\n1 { inspect_at(\"OutpostY\", T) : time(T) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: moves between adjacent nodes takes 1 timestep"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each inspection requires 1 full timestep at the inspection site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: each movement consumes 1 battery unit"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "move(L1, L2, T) :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), edge(L1, L2), L1 != L2.\nused_battery(N, T) :- N = #count { T1 : move(_, _, T1), T1 < T }, time(T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the battery stores 6 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "remaining_battery(N1, T) :- used_battery(N2, T), N1 = 6 - N2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only allow inspection of relaystation if there are 2 battery units once the other sites are scanned"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0 { inspect_at(\"RelayStation\", T) : time(T) } 1.\n:- inspect_at(\"RelayStation\", _), remaining_battery(N, T), N <= 2, sites_scanned(T).\nsites_scanned(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(L, T1), L != \"RelayStation\"}."}]}

Both days are sliced into four\nsegments \u2014 morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon \u2014 and\nyou have five distinct rooms at your disposal.\nNaturally, every seminar must find its place in the programme, and no room ever\nhosts more than one talk at once. To keep the flow manageable and give each\nroom a little breathing room, no room may be booked for more than half of the \ntime slots in a single day, nor may it run back\u2011to\u2011back sessions without a break.\nAlso, bear in mind that Room\u202f3 goes offline once afternoon begins,\nand Room\u202f5 lacks any projection equipment, so any seminar requiring slides\nwon\u2019t fit there.\nSpeaking of equipment, both AI and Mathematics talks rely on a working projector,\nand the AI presentations have an early\u2011day preference: they\u2019re confined to the\nmorning or late\u2011morning slots. Biology seminars, by contrast, must be sprinkled\nacross the two days \u2014 never exclusively in one \u2014 and you cannot have two bio talks\ntaking place simultaneously. Chemistry talks, on the other hand, are social\nin time but solitary in space: no two of them may ever occupy the same\nroom. Additionally, you can\u2019t mix a Bio session with a Chem\nsession under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.\nThere\u2019s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close\nwith mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both\nmathematics events. Beyond that, you\u2019ll want to avoid empty slots\nunless there\u2019s simply no alternative. Each time segment should showcase as\nmany different topics as possible, and while it\u2019s fine for Biology and Chemistry\nto overlap with other sessions, no more than two Bio\u2011or\u2011Chem seminars may ever\nrun at the same moment.\nWith these guidelines in mind, you\u2019ll blend room capacities, projector access, \ntemporal preferences, and topic distributions into a single, seamless schedule \nthat serves presenters, attendees, and the venues\u2019 technical quirks without leaving\nunnecessary gaps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars are on AI, Bio, Math, or Chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\";

The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250.

Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4. Boundary Conditions\n*   **Initialization:** The session $(d=1, s=\\text{early morning})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{AI\\}$ domain.\n*   **Termination:** The session $(d=4, s=\\text{early afternoon})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{VR\\}$ domain.\n\n### 5. Optimization Objectives\nIn the event that multiple feasible schedules exist, the optimal schedule shall be determined by the following lexicographical preference order:\n1.  **Maximize Spatial Parallelism:** Maximize the number of rooms utilized during each active session $(d, s)$.\n2.  **Maximize Efficiency:** Minimize the total number of idle (unassigned) room-time slots across the global schedule, subject to the preservation of all primary constraints.\n\n**Task:**\nFormalize the above as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

No single room can host more than two workshops on any given day, and to prevent burnout, we must ensure there is always a break between sessions; this means back-to-back bookings in the same room are not permitted. We also have some specific venue limitations to navigate, as Room 2 will be closed every evening, and Room 4 is not equipped to handle the technical requirements for AI or Physics sessions.\n\nThematically, each discipline has its own set of scheduling rules. All Artificial Intelligence workshops must be held during the morning sessions, while Physics presentations are restricted to the first two days and cannot take place on the final day of the event. Our Mathematics sessions are limited to being held in either Room 1 or Room 3. Linguistics workshops require a bit more breathing room, so we must ensure that no two Linguistics sessions ever run concurrently across the venue.\n\nTo keep the daily schedule organized, we\u2019ve decided that each room should only host one specific discipline per day, meaning you won\u2019t see different topics rotating through the same four walls within a single twenty-four-hour period. Furthermore, to provide a well-rounded experience for our attendees, we need to make sure that at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines is represented every day. We also have two specific requirements for our program's bookends: the very first workshop of the symposium must be an AI presentation, and the final session of the third day must be a Linguistics talk.\n\nOur objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the use of our available rooms and time slots without overextending the staff or breaking any of these established rules. We want to fill as many of the available slots as the logic allows, ensuring the symposium is as robust as possible while respecting every constraint."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Workshops and Topics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "workshop(1..12).\ntopic(\"AI\"; \"Physics\"; \"Math\"; \"Linguistics\").\n1 { topicOf(W, T) : topic(T) } 1 :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Time and Structure"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..3).\nslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"evening\").\nroom(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Every workshop must be scheduled"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 {scheduled(W, R, S, D) : room(R), slot(S), day(D)} :- workshop(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one workshop per room per time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, S, D), scheduled(W2, R, S, D), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most 2 sessions per room per day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{scheduled(W, R, S, D) : workshop(W), slot(S)} 2 :- room(R), day(D)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No room can be used in adjacent time slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "adjacent(\"morning\", \"midday\").\nadjacent(\"midday\", \"evening\").\n:- scheduled(_, R, S1, D), scheduled(_, R, S2, D), adjacent(S1, S2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 cannot be used in the evening"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 2, \"evening\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 4 cannot host AI or Physics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, 4, _, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\").\n:- scheduled(W, 4, _, _), topicOf(W, \"Physics\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: AI workshops must be in the morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, S, _), topicOf(W, \"AI\"), S != \"morning\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Physics workshops must be held on the first or second day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, _, _, D), topicOf(W, \"Physics\"), D = 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: All Math workshops must be scheduled in Room 1 or Room 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W, R, _, _), topicOf(W, \"Math\"), R != 1, R != 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Linguistics workshops must not overlap in time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, _, S, D), scheduled(W2, _, S, D), topicOf(W1, \"Linguistics\"),\ntopicOf(W2, \"Linguistics\"), W1 != W2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No room may host workshops from different topics on the same day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(W1, R, _, D), scheduled(W2, R, _, D), topicOf(W1, T1),\ntopicOf(W2, T2), T1 != T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least one workshop per topic must occur each day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(D), topic(T), not scheduled(_, _, _, D) : topicOf(_, T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Time encoding for total ordering"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "slotOrder(\"morning\", 1).\nslotOrder(\"midday\", 2).\nslotOrder(\"evening\", 3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Compute time index"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeIndex(D, S, I) :- day(D), slot(S), slotOrder(S, O), I = (D - 1) * 3 + O."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Assign each scheduled workshop its time index"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "wTime(W, I) :- scheduled(W, _, S, D), timeIndex(D, S, I)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Find the minimum and maximum index among all scheduled workshops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "minTime(I) :- I = #min {J : wTime(_, J)}.\nmaxTime(I) :- I = #max {J : wTime(_, J)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: First workshop must be AI"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- wTime(W, I), minTime(I), not topicOf(W, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Last workshop must be Linguistics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- wTime(W, I), maxTime(I), not topicOf(W, \"Linguistics\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used in each time slot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(R, S, D) :- scheduled(_, R, S, D).\nroomsUsed(N, S, D) :- N = #count{R : used(R, S, D)}, slot(S), day(D).\n#maximize {N : roomsUsed(N, S, D)}."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize idle slots"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "idle(R, S, D) :- room(R), slot(S), day(D), not used(R, S, D).\nnum_idle(N) :- N = #count{R, S, D: idle(R, S, D) }.\n#minimize { N: num_idle(N) }."}]}

We need to select exactly one component from three specific categories\u2014CPUs, GPUs, and power supplies\u2014while staying within some pretty rigid technical and financial guardrails.\n\nFor the processor, we have three options: the BoltX, which pulls 85W and costs $400; the HydraPro, at 125W for $550; and the LiteCore, which is the modest choice at 60W for $350. When it comes to the graphics card, we\u2019re looking at the StormZ at 180W for $800, the Nebula9 at 150W for $650, or the VegaLite at 95W for $500. To keep everything running, we can choose between the PowerMax750 with a 750W capacity for $200, the Eco600 with 600W for $150, or the beefy Titan900 at 900W for $250.\n\nThe first major hurdle is the safety buffer for our power draw. To avoid any system failures during peak rendering bursts, the combined wattage of the CPU and GPU you choose must be at least 100W lower than the maximum capacity of the power supply. On top of that, the committee has a strange rule regarding cost justification: whichever component in your final build has the highest wattage must also be the most expensive component in the set.\n\nThere are also a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. The HydraPro doesn't play well with the VegaLite because of thermal constraints, so those two can't be in the same machine. Similarly, if you decide to go with the Eco600 power supply, you\u2019ll have to skip the StormZ GPU, as that card requires better voltage regulation than the Eco model can provide. \n\nFinally, we have to keep the accounting department happy. They\u2019ve explicitly forbidden us from simply picking the cheapest option from all three categories for a single build. Furthermore, to keep the quality of the parts somewhat consistent, no two components in the system can have a price difference greater than $400. It\u2019s going to take some careful balancing to make sure we meet all these requirements without the whole thing blowing up\u2014literally or financially."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpus  boltx hydrapro litecore"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"BoltX\"; \"HydraPro\"; \"LiteCore\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: wattages boltx 85 hydrapro 125 litecore 60"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "watt(\"BoltX\", 85; \"HydraPro\", 125; \"LiteCore\", 60)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs boltx 400 hydrapro 550 litecore 350"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"BoltX\", 400; \"HydraPro\", 550; \"LiteCore\", 350)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpus  stormz nebula9 vegalite"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "gpu(\"StormZ\"; \"Nebula9\"; \"VegaLite\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: wattages stormz 180 nebula9 150 vegalite 95"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "watt(\"StormZ\", 180; \"Nebula9\", 150; \"VegaLite\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs stormz 800 nebula9 650 vegalite 500"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"StormZ\", 800; \"Nebula9\", 650; \"VegaLite\", 500)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: psus  powermax750 eco600 titan900"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "psu(\"PowerMax750\"; \"Eco600\"; \"Titan900\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: capacities powermax750 750 eco600 600 titan900 900"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "capacity(\"PowerMax750\", 750; \"Eco600\", 600; \"Titan900\", 900)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: costs powermax750 200 eco600 150 titan900 250"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"PowerMax750\", 200; \"Eco600\", 150; \"Titan900\", 250)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select one cpu one gpu one psu"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_psu(P) : psu(P) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: total cpugpu draw \u2264 psu capacity  100"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected_total_draw(D) :- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), watt(C, WC), watt(G, WG), D = WC + WG.\n:- selected_psu(P), selected_total_draw(D), capacity(P, CP), D > CP - 100."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: most powerhungry part must also be most expensive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_psu(X).\nmax_watt(X) :- watt(X, W), W = #max {W1 : selected(Y), watt(Y, W1)}.\nmax_cost(X) :- cost(X, C), C = #max {C1 : selected(Y), cost(Y, C1)}.\n:- selected(X), max_watt(X), not max_cost(X)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: incompatible pairs hydrapro vegalite eco600 stormz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"HydraPro\"), selected_gpu(\"VegaLite\").\n:- selected_psu(\"Eco600\"), selected_gpu(\"StormZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: do not select all three cheapest components"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cheapest_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), cost(C, V), V = #min {V1 : cpu(C1), cost(C1, V1)}.\ncheapest_gpu(G) :- gpu(G), cost(G, V), V = #min {V1 : gpu(G1), cost(G1, V1)}.\ncheapest_psu(P) :- psu(P), cost(P, V), V = #min {V1 : psu(P1), cost(P1, V1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), cheapest_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), cheapest_gpu(G), selected_psu(P), cheapest_psu(P)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no two selected components can differ in cost by more than 400"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(X), selected(Y), cost(X, CX), cost(Y, CY), CX - CY > 400.\n:- selected(X), selected(Y), cost(Y, CY), cost(X, CX), CY - CX > 400."}]}

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

Each seminar $s \\in S$ is categorized into one of four disjoint fields $F = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology (B), Mathematics (M), Chemistry (C)}\\}$. The symposium schedule must be mapped to a set of temporal slots $T$ and spatial resources $R$.\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Domain**\n*   **Temporal Domain:** The symposium spans two days ($D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$). Each day is partitioned into four sequential segments: morning ($t_1$), late morning ($t_2$), early afternoon ($t_3$), and late afternoon ($t_4$).\n*   **Spatial Domain:** There are five distinct venues available ($R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$).\n*   **Capacity:** Each room may host at most one seminar per time segment.\n\n**2. Spatial and Operational Constraints**\n*   **Utilization Limits:** For any room $r \\in R$ and any day $d \\in D$, the total number of scheduled seminars cannot exceed two (50% of daily capacity).\n*   **Temporal Adjacency:** To ensure adequate transition intervals, no room may host seminars in consecutive time segments (e.g., if a seminar occurs in $t_n$, the room must remain vacant during $t_{n-1}$ and $t_{n+1}$).\n*   **Venue-Specific Availability:** Room $r_3$ is unavailable during the afternoon segments ($t_3, t_4$) of both days.\n*   **Technical Specifications:** Seminars in the fields of AI and Mathematics require projection hardware. Room $r_5$ lacks such hardware and is therefore ineligible to host sessions from these domains.\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Constraints**\n*   **AI Temporal Preference:** Seminars in Artificial Intelligence are restricted to the morning segments ($t_1, t_2$) of either day.\n*   **Biology Distribution:** Biology seminars must be distributed across both $d_1$ and $d_2$; they cannot be concentrated on a single day. Furthermore, no two Biology seminars may occur concurrently.\n*   **Chemistry Spatial Exclusivity:** A room $r$ may host at most one Chemistry seminar over the entire duration of the symposium.\n*   **Field Incompatibility:** On any given day $d$, a room $r$ cannot host both a Biology seminar and a Chemistry seminar. These domains are mutually exclusive within the same spatial-temporal day-track.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The symposium must be bounded by Mathematics. The initial seminar of the program ($d_1, t_1$) and the terminal seminar of the program ($d_2, t_4$) must both belong to the Mathematics domain.\n\n**4.

We have two speakers to choose from, the Alpha and the Beta, along with two different amplifiers, AmpX and AmpY, and two media players, Streamer1 and Streamer2. The catch is that we have to be very careful about how we pair them up to ensure the system actually works. \n\nFor instance, the Alpha speaker is a bit finicky and will only work if we use AmpX to power it. On the digital side, we have to remember that AmpY and Streamer1 are completely incompatible with each other, so those two can never be used in the same configuration. To make matters even more complicated, the Streamer2 is designed with a very specific output that only functions when it's paired with the Beta speaker.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThe procurement team has adopted a new philosophy for our latest batch of data-processing workstations, moving away from raw power in favor of what they call \"proportional utility.\" As you start putting these builds together, you\u2019ll need to select exactly one component from each of the three categories available in our inventory. For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU. Additionally, we have to avoid extreme performance gaps; the difference between your highest-performing component and your lowest-performing component cannot exceed 50 points. If your configuration includes the FlashNova SSD, you are required to select a GPU with a performance score of at least 100.

Each presentation $p_i$ is associated with exactly one domain $k$ from the set $K = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (C), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR)}\\}$. \n\nThe event occurs over a temporal horizon of four days, $D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with each day partitioned into four discrete, sequential sessions: $S = \\{\\text{early morning}, \\text{late morning}, \\text{early afternoon}, \\text{late afternoon}\\}$. Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4. Boundary Conditions\n*   **Initialization:** The session $(d=1, s=\\text{early morning})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{AI\\}$ domain.\n*   **Termination:** The session $(d=4, s=\\text{early afternoon})$ is reserved exclusively for a presentation from the $\\{VR\\}$ domain.\n\n### 5. Optimization Objectives\nIn the event that multiple feasible schedules exist, the optimal schedule shall be determined by the following lexicographical preference order:\n1.  **Maximize Spatial Parallelism:** Maximize the number of rooms utilized during each active session $(d, s)$.\n2.  **Maximize Efficiency:** Minimize the total number of idle (unassigned) room-time slots across the global schedule, subject to the preservation of all primary constraints.\n\n**Task:**\nFormalize the above as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

The event unfolds over four days, and each day is\nstructured into four distinct sessions: early morning, late morning, early\nafternoon, and late afternoon. A total of five rooms are available throughout\nthe event.\nEach of the ten presentations must be scheduled \u2014 no omissions \u2014 and\nonly one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT\npresentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they\ncan\u2019t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids\nAI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day \u2014 those topics\nmust not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.\nYou\u2019ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely\nrelated topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not\nexcessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the\nsame time slot, regardless of room.\nA few time-critical constraints must be obeyed.

Both days are sliced into four\nsegments \u2014 morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon \u2014 and\nyou have five distinct rooms at your disposal.\nNaturally, every seminar must find its place in the programme, and no room ever\nhosts more than one talk at once. To keep the flow manageable and give each\nroom a little breathing room, no room may be booked for more than half of the \ntime slots in a single day, nor may it run back\u2011to\u2011back sessions without a break.\nAlso, bear in mind that Room\u202f3 goes offline once afternoon begins,\nand Room\u202f5 lacks any projection equipment, so any seminar requiring slides\nwon\u2019t fit there.\nSpeaking of equipment, both AI and Mathematics talks rely on a working projector,\nand the AI presentations have an early\u2011day preference: they\u2019re confined to the\nmorning or late\u2011morning slots. Biology seminars, by contrast, must be sprinkled\nacross the two days \u2014 never exclusively in one \u2014 and you cannot have two bio talks\ntaking place simultaneously. Chemistry talks, on the other hand, are social\nin time but solitary in space: no two of them may ever occupy the same\nroom. Additionally, you can\u2019t mix a Bio session with a Chem\nsession under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.\nThere\u2019s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close\nwith mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both\nmathematics events. Beyond that, you\u2019ll want to avoid empty slots\nunless there\u2019s simply no alternative. Each time segment should showcase as\nmany different topics as possible, and while it\u2019s fine for Biology and Chemistry\nto overlap with other sessions, no more than two Bio\u2011or\u2011Chem seminars may ever\nrun at the same moment.\nWith these guidelines in mind, you\u2019ll blend room capacities, projector access, \ntemporal preferences, and topic distributions into a single, seamless schedule \nthat serves presenters, attendees, and the venues\u2019 technical quirks without leaving\nunnecessary gaps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The time slots are morining, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\";

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Clingo programmer. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn automated underwater vehicle (AUV) is launched from a Surface Hub to perform a critical inspection of several submerged research stations linked by a web of one-way navigational currents. Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed. If two paths result in the same number of sweeps, the strategy that completes the mandatory sweeps (X and Y) in the shortest total time is preferred.\n*   **Sensor Safety:** To prevent equipment fatigue, the AUV is strictly forbidden from performing back-to-back sensor sweeps at the same station."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}

Consider a selection problem where an engineer must choose exactly one entity from each of three disjoint sets of components: Central Processing Units ($\\mathcal{C}$), Graphics Processing Units ($\\mathcal{G}$), and Storage Drives ($\\mathcal{D}$). Each component $i$ is defined by a cost attribute $p_i$ (in USD) and a performance metric $v_i$ (in points).\n\nThe available component specifications are provided in the following tables:\n\n**Table 1: CPUs ($\\mathcal{C}$)**\n| Component ($c$) | Cost ($p_c$) | Performance ($v_c$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| FalconX | \\$600 | 125 |\n| CoreZen | \\$500 | 115 |\n| EcoMini | \\$300 | 90 |\n\n**Table 2: GPUs ($\\mathcal{G}$)**\n| Component ($g$) | Cost ($p_g$) | Performance ($v_g$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| TitanZ | \\$700 | 135 |\n| MidlineGT | \\$500 | 100 |\n| Pixie | \\$400 | 95 |\n\n**Table 3: Storage Drives ($\\mathcal{D}$)**\n| Component ($d$) | Cost ($p_d$) | Performance ($v_d$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| FlashNova | \\$250 | 110 |\n| Terabox | \\$300 | 100 |\n| BudgetDisk | \\$150 | 60 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nA valid system configuration $S = \\{c, g, d\\}$ must satisfy the following six conditions:\n\n1.  **Strict Performance Intermediate:** The performance metric of the GPU ($v_g$) must strictly reside between the performance metrics of the CPU ($v_c$) and the Storage Drive ($v_d$). That is, $v_g \\neq \\max(v_c, v_g, v_d)$ and $v_g \\neq \\min(v_c, v_g, v_d)$.\n2.  **Median Cost Minimality:** The component $i \\in S$ possessing the median performance value must also satisfy the condition $p_i = \\min(p_c, p_g, p_d)$.\n3.  **Conditional GPU Exclusion:** If $p_c > 500$, then $g \\neq \\text{Pixie}$.\n4.  **Performance Variance Limitation:** The performance spread, defined as $\\max(v_c, v_g, v_d) - \\min(v_c, v_g, v_d)$, must not exceed 50 units.\n5.  **Subsystem Dependency:** If $d = \\text{FlashNova}$, then $v_g \\geq 100$.\n6.  **Cardinality of High-Cost Components:** The set of components $\\{i \\in S \\mid p_i > 300\\}$ must have a cardinality of exactly 2.\n\n**Required:**\nDetermine the feasible configuration(s) that satisfy all aforementioned constraints.

The mission parameters involve gathering liquid specimens at Site Alpha and Site Beta, with an additional specimen from Site Gamma being authorized only if the schedule permits. \n\n**System Topology and Expenditure:**\nThe probe\u2019s propulsion and storage system has a maximum capacity of 16 energy/volume units. Every movement between nodes takes exactly 1 minute, while the act of extracting a specimen takes 1 minute and consumes 1 unit of capacity.\n*   **From Deployment Hub:** Two primary arteries diverge. Arterial Path 1 (2-unit cost) reaches Site Alpha (1-unit access cost). Arterial Path 2 (3-unit cost) leads toward Site Beta or a Calibration Shaft.\n*   **From Site Alpha:** The probe can take Connector 3 (1-unit cost) to merge into Arterial Path 2.\n*   **From Arterial Path 2:** The probe may proceed to Site Beta (1-unit access cost) or enter the Calibration Shaft (2-unit access cost).\n*   **From Calibration Shaft:** Entry is permitted into Site Gamma (1-unit access cost).\n*   **From Site Gamma:** A return flow allows the probe to re-enter Arterial Path 1 at a cost of 2 units.\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n1.  **Temporal & Volumetric Limits:** The probe begins at T-0 with 16 units. It must conclude all operations within a 10-minute window. It cannot exceed its 16-unit storage limit at any time.\n2.  **Maintenance Protocol:** While at the Calibration Shaft, the probe may remain idle for 2 consecutive minutes to recover 3 units of capacity. This recharge protocol is restricted to a single occurrence.\n3.  **Mission Requirements:** Samples from Site Alpha and Site Beta are compulsory. The Alpha specimen must be secured no later than the 6-minute mark.\n4.  **Conditional Objective:** Sampling Site Gamma is mandatory if, and only if, the two compulsory samples (Alpha and Beta) are successfully collected within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n5.  **Event Cap:** The cumulative total of all discrete actions\u2014movements, sampling procedures, and recharge idles\u2014is strictly capped at 18 events.\n6.  **Purity Protocol:** To prevent cross-contamination, the probe is prohibited from performing back-to-back sampling actions at the same location.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n*   **Primary Priority:** Maximize the total quantity of specimens collected (Compulsory + Optional).\n*   **Secondary Priority:** Minimize the timestamp at which the final compulsory sample is obtained."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Locations: HubWest, NodeA, NodeB, Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"HubWest\"; \"NodeA\"; \"NodeB\"; \"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If NodeB is visited before Sensor1, then NodeA may not be visited afterward"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeB\", T1), at(\"Sensor1\", T2), at(\"NodeA\", T3), T1 < T2 < T3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Edges: (HubWest\u2013NodeA), (HubWest\u2013NodeB), (NodeA\u2013Sensor1), (NodeB\u2013Sensor2), (NodeA\u2013NodeB)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeA\").\nedge(\"HubWest\", \"NodeB\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"Sensor1\").\nedge(\"NodeB\", \"Sensor2\").\nedge(\"NodeA\", \"NodeB\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Max duration: 9 minutes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..9)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling targets: Sensor1, Sensor2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "inspect(\"Sensor1\"; \"Sensor2\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each sample requires a full minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(L, T) : time(T) } 1 :- inspect(L).\nat(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes costs 1 minute"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start location: HubWest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"HubWest\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: A minimum of three timesteps between samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- inspect_at(_, T1), inspect_at(_, T2), 0 < T1 - T2 < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Minimize time by which both samples are completed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "latest_inspect(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(_, T1) }.\n#minimize { T : latest_inspect(T) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous rover is tasked with collecting critical samples in a subterranean Mars base tunnel network. The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations. If multiple route \nplans achieve the same sample count, priority should be given to the plan that completes the mandatory sampling \noperations (StationA and StationB) in the least amount of time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: LaunchPad, Tunnel1, Tunnel2, StationA, StationB, Tunnel3, CalibEdge, StationC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"LaunchPad\"; \"Tunnel1\"; \"Tunnel2\"; \"StationA\"; \"StationB\"; \"Tunnel3\"; \"CalibEdge\"; \"StationC\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges & Water Costs (L):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel1\",2).\nedge(\"LaunchPad\",\"Tunnel2\",3).\nedge(\"Tunnel1\",\"StationA\",1).\nedge(\"StationA\",\"Tunnel3\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel3\",\"Tunnel2\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"StationB\",1).\nedge(\"Tunnel2\",\"CalibEdge\",2).\nedge(\"CalibEdge\",\"StationC\",1).\nedge(\"StationC\",\"Tunnel1\",2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Start at launchpad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"LaunchPad\",0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement: 1\u202fmin per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Tank Capacity: 16\u202fL."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tank(0,16).\ntank(T+1, W2) :- tank(T, W1), at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,C), W2 = W1 - C.\n:- tank(_, W), W < 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Mandatory Samples: StationA, StationB (exactly once each)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T) }.\n1 { sampled(\"StationB\",T): time(T) }.\n0 { sampled(\"StationC\",T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Sampling: 1\u202fmin, +1\u202fL per sample."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- sampled(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- sampled(L,T).\ntank(T+1,W+1) :- tank(T,W), sampled(L,T), W<16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Refill at CalibEdge: 2 min \u2192 +3L, at most once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "refill(T) :- at(\"CalibEdge\",T), at(\"CalibEdge\",T+1).\n:- refill(T1), refill(T2), T1 != T2.\ntank(T+2, V + 3) :- tank(T,V), refill(T), V < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: No consecutive samples at same site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- sampled(L,T1), sampled(L,T2), T2 = T1+2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationA must finish by time 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not sampled(\"StationA\",T): time(T), T <= 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: StationC sampled if and only if mandatory samples finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- sampled(\"StationA\",TA), sampled(\"StationB\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- sampled(\"StationC\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not sampled(\"StationC\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Event Limit: \u2264 18 events (moves + samples + refill)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "event(T) :- at(L1,T-1), at(L2,T), L1 != L2.\nevent(T) :- sampled(_,T).\nevent(T) :- refill(T).\n:- N = #count {E: event(E)}, N>18."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Primary: maximize samples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "samples(N) :- N = #count {T: sampled(L,T)}.\n#maximize { N@2: samples(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Secondary: minimize latest mandatory sample time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mtime(M) :- M = #min{T1: sampled(\"StationA\",T2), sampled(\"StationB\",T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { M@1: mtime(M) }."}]}

Each session $s_i$ is characterized by an attribute $A$, representing its technical domain, such that $A(s_i) \\in \\{\\text{Networking}, \\text{Security}\\}$.\n\n**Available Resources:**\nThe allocation must occur within a discrete spatio-temporal domain defined by:\n1.  A set of temporal slots $T = \\{t_{morning}, t_{afternoon}\\}$.\n2.  A set of spatial venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n\n**Objective:**\nDefine a schedule as a mapping $f: S \\to T \\times R$ that assigns each session to a unique coordinate in the resource grid, subject to the following system of constraints:\n\n**1. Resource Exclusivity (Injectivity Constraint):**\nThe mapping $f$ must be injective. Specifically, for any two distinct sessions $s_i, s_j \\in S$:\n$$s_i \\neq s_j \\implies f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$$\nThis ensures that no two sessions occupy the same room during the same time slot. Given $|S| = |T \\times R|$, the mapping must be bijective.\n\n**2. Domain-Specific Temporal Constraints:**\nLet $proj_T$ be the projection of the schedule onto the temporal set $T$. For any session $s_i \\in S$:\n$$\\text{If } A(s_i) = \\text{Security}, \\text{ then } proj_T(f(s_i)) = t_{afternoon}$$\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints:**\nLet $proj_R$ be the projection of the schedule onto the set of rooms $R$. For any session $s_i \\in S$:\n$$\\text{If } A(s_i) = \\text{Networking}, \\text{ then } proj_R(f(s_i)) \\in R \\setminus \\{r_1\\}$$\n\n---\n\n**Tasks:**\n1.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine the maximum number of sessions that can be categorized as 'Networking' and 'Security' respectively for a valid schedule to exist.\n2.  **Formal Modeling:** Represent this problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Define the variables, domains, and the consistency requirements.\n3.  **Assignment:** Assume two sessions are 'Networking' and two are 'Security'.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Resource Allocation and Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement**\nA technical symposium requires the scheduling of a set of ten presentations, denoted by $P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{10}\\}$. Each presentation $p_i$ is associated with exactly one domain $k$ from the set $K = \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (C), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR)}\\}$. \n\nThe event occurs over a temporal horizon of four days, $D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with each day partitioned into four discrete, sequential sessions: $S = \\{\\text{early morning}, \\text{late morning}, \\text{early afternoon}, \\text{late afternoon}\\}$. Five distinct physical venues (rooms), $R = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, are available for allocation.\n\nA feasible schedule must map every presentation $p \\in P$ to a unique triplet $(d, s, r) \\in D \\times S \\times R$ such that all following constraints are satisfied:\n\n### 1. Resource and Temporal Constraints\n*   **Unique Occupancy:** Each room-time coordinate $(d, s, r)$ may host at most one presentation.\n*   **Room Utilization Limits:** For any room $r$ on any day $d$, the total number of assigned sessions $n_{r,d}$ must satisfy $n_{r,d} \\le 3$.\n*   **Temporal Contiguity:** To prevent back-to-back scheduling, no room $r$ may host presentations in consecutive sessions $(s_j, s_{j+1})$ within the same day $d$.\n\n### 2. Domain-Specific Spatial Constraints\n*   **Equipment Requirements:** Room $r=2$ is designated as lacking projection hardware. Consequently, sessions belonging to domains $\\{AI, C\\}$ are prohibited from this venue.\n*   **Venue Exclusion:** Presentations in the domain $\\{VR\\}$ are strictly prohibited from Room $r=1$ for the duration of the event.\n*   **Spatial Separation:** Sessions belonging to the domains $\\{AI\\}$ and $\\{VR\\}$ are mutually exclusive with respect to room-day pairings. Formally, for any $r \\in R$ and $d \\in D$, if an $\\{AI\\}$ presentation is scheduled, no $\\{VR\\}$ presentation may occur in the same room on that day, and vice versa.\n\n### 3. Distribution and Concurrency Constraints\n*   **Temporal Dispersion:** The subset of presentations $P_{IoT} \\subseteq P$ must be distributed across at least three distinct days $d \\in D$.\n*   **Bounded Concurrency:** For any specific time slot $(d, s)$, the total number of concurrent presentations from the union of domains $\\{C \\cup IoT\\}$ across all rooms $R$ must not exceed two.\n*   **Topical Diversity:** In any session $(d, s)$ where presentations are occurring, at least two distinct domains $k \\in K$ must be represented. No single domain may hold a monopoly over a specific time slot.\n*   **Daily Minimum Activity:** Every day $d \\in D$ must host at least one presentation.\n\n### 4.

We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes.

For CPUs, we have the high-end FalconX priced at $600 with a performance rating of 125 points, the mid-range CoreZen at $500 with 115 points, and the more modest EcoMini for $300 with 90 points. Our GPU options include the powerful TitanZ at $700 with 135 points, the MidlineGT at $500 with 100 points, and the Pixie at $400 with 95 points. Finally, for storage, you can choose the FlashNova drive for $250 with 110 points, the Terabox for $300 with 100 points, or the BudgetDisk at $150 with 60 points.\n\nThe assembly process is governed by several strict balancing rules to ensure the systems aren't lopsided. First, you must ensure that exactly two of the components you select are priced higher than $300. This interacts directly with a performance requirement where the GPU\u2019s score must be the \"middle\" value of the three parts\u2014it cannot be the highest-rated or the lowest-rated component in your build. Furthermore, whichever component ends up having that middle performance score must also be the least expensive item of the three you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nThere are also specific compatibility and stability constraints to keep in mind. If you decide to use a CPU that costs more than $500, you are barred from pairing it with the Pixie GPU.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit\nconsecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}]}

We have four rooms at our disposal for these sessions, but keep in mind that a room can only host one seminar during any single time slot.\n\nWhen you start mapping out the topics\u2014AI, Biology, and Math\u2014there are several departmental requirements we have to honor. The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.\n\nWe also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you\u2019ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nFinally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot. Additionally, for Seminars 6 and 7, the organizers have requested that they both be held in the exact same room, though they must be scheduled on different days to give the attendees some breathing room between the two sessions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 10 seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: seminars have topics ai bio or math"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Bio\"; \"Math\").\n1{topicOf(S, T): topic(T)}1 :- seminar(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 2 days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1; 2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 3 time slots per day morning midday afternoon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "timeslot(\"morning\"; \"midday\"; \"afternoon\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: there are 4 rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: only one seminar can be scheduled in a room at a time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{scheduled(S, R, T, D): room(R), timeslot(T), day(D)} :- seminar(S).\n:- schedule(S1, D, T, R), schedule(S2, D, T, R), S1 != S2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: ai seminars must be in the morning or midday"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(S, _, \"afternoon\", _), topicOf(S, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bio seminars must happen in at least 2 different rooms"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "bioRoom(R) :- scheduled(S,_,_,R), topicOf(S, \"Bio\").\n:- #count { R : bioRoom(R) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: room 4 is not available at midday on either day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, 4, \"midday\", _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: no two math seminars can happen at the same time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(S1, _, T, D), scheduled(S2, _, T, D), S1 != S2,\ntopicOf(S1, \"Math\"), topicOf(S2, \"Math\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: seminar 5 must happen on day 2 but not in the morning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{scheduled(5, R, T, 2): T != \"morning\", timeslot(T), room(R)}1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: seminars 6 and 7 must happen in the same room but on different days"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(6,R1,T1,D1), scheduled(7,R2,T2,D2), R1 != R2.\n:- scheduled(6,R,T1,D), scheduled(7,R,T2,D)."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous submersible departs from its primary Launch Bay into a network of undersea corridors. These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor.

A total of five rooms are available throughout\nthe event.\nEach of the ten presentations must be scheduled \u2014 no omissions \u2014 and\nonly one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT\npresentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they\ncan\u2019t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids\nAI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day \u2014 those topics\nmust not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.\nYou\u2019ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely\nrelated topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not\nexcessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the\nsame time slot, regardless of room.\nA few time-critical constraints must be obeyed. The first scheduled session on Day 1,\noccurring in the early morning, must be an AI presentation \u2014 no other topic is\npermitted to occupy that slot. At the other end of the schedule, the early afternoon\nsession on Day 4 must be reserved exclusively for VR; no other topic may take that\nposition.\nTo ensure consistent coverage and audience engagement, each day must include at least\none presentation, even if others remain unassigned. And each time slot, across all\nrooms, should exhibit at least two different topics \u2014 no slot should be monopolized\nby a single subject area.\nFinally, when multiple valid schedules satisfy all the constraints, preference should\nbe given to those that maximize the number of rooms in use during each session.\nOnce that\u2019s achieved, the next priority is to minimize idle room-time slots overall,\nwithout violating any rule that would otherwise disqualify a more efficient layout."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 presentations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "presentation(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Presentations are in AI, Cloud, IoT, or VR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\"; \"Cloud\"; \"IoT\"; \"VR\").\n1 { topicOf(V8, Day) : topic(Day) } 1 :- presentation(V8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The schedule spans 4 days, with 4 time slots per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "day(1..4).\nslot(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "room(1..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each presentation must be scheduled."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { scheduled(T, G, Computing, V12) : room(G), slot(Computing), day(V12) } :- presentation(T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only one presentation per room\u2011time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(V13, V14, Computing, V11), scheduled(V0, V14, Computing, V11), V13 != V0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each room can be used at most three times per day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scheduled(V0, F, V15, V8) : presentation(V0), slot(V15) } 3 :- room(F), day(V8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Rooms cannot be booked in consecutive slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(_, Artificial, V3, V5), scheduled(_, Artificial, X, V5), V3 = X - 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Room 2 has no projector; AI and Cloud require a projector."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-projector(2).\n:- scheduled(V17, W, _, _), topicOf(V17, V9), V9 = \"AI\", -projector(W).\n:- scheduled(V17, W, _, _), topicOf(V17, V9), V9 = \"Cloud\", -projector(W)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR cannot be in room 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(V19, 1, _, _), topicOf(V19, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: IoT presentations must be spread across at least three days."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasIoT(V0) :- scheduled(V7, _, _, V0), topicOf(V7, \"IoT\").\n:- #count { V0 : hasIoT(V0) } < 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: VR and AI cannot be on the same day in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(V16, V1, _, X), scheduled(W, V1, _, X),\ntopicOf(V16, \"VR\"), topicOf(W, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At most two Cloud and IoT presentations may overlap in any slot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cloudOrIoT(Things, V, Things) :- scheduled(Things, _, V, Things), topicOf(Things, \"Cloud\").\ncloudOrIoT(Things, V, Things) :- scheduled(Things, _, V, Things), topicOf(Things, \"IoT\").\n:- day(Things), slot(K), #count { Things : cloudOrIoT(Things, V, Things) } > 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only AI can be in slot 1 of day 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(V3, _, 1, 1), not topicOf(V3, \"AI\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only VR can be in slot 3 of day 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scheduled(Meanwhile, _, 3, 4), not topicOf(Meanwhile, \"VR\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each day must have at least one presentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- day(Intelligence), not scheduled(_, _, _, Intelligence)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: At least two different topics must occur in every time slot across all rooms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hasTopic(V2, G, L) :- scheduled(L, _, G, L), topicOf(L, V2).\n:- slot(G), day(L), #count { V2 : hasTopic(V2, G, L) } < 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize the number of rooms used per slot, then minimize idle slots."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used(Things, K, Internet) :- scheduled(_, Things, K, Internet).\nroomsUsed(G, K, Internet) :- G = #count { Things : used(Things, K, Internet) }, slot(K), day(Internet).\n#maximize { G@2 : roomsUsed(G, K, Internet) }.\nidle(Things, K, Internet) :- room(Things), slot(K), day(Internet), not used(Things, K, Internet).\nnum_idle(G) :- G = #count{Things, K, Internet: idle(Things, K, Internet) }.\n#minimize { G@1: num_idle(G) }."}]}

The set of undirected edges $E$ is defined by the following adjacency relations:\n*   $S_1$ is adjacent to $\\{J_1, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_1$ is adjacent to $\\{A, J_2\\}$\n*   $J_2$ is adjacent to $\\{B, J_1\\}$\n\n**Operational Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Task Requirements:** The agent must perform an inspection operation at both $A$ and $B$ at least once. An inspection is defined as a stationary action performed at a target vertex.\n2.  **Energy Model:** \n    *   **Traversal Cost:** The transition between any two adjacent vertices $u, v \\in V$ incurs a constant energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Action Cost:** Each inspection operation performed at $A$ or $B$ incurs an energy expenditure of $1 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n    *   **Capacity:** The agent is initialized with a total energy budget of $E_{max} = 8 \\, \\text{kJ}$.\n3.  **Signal Interference Constraint:** Let $P = (v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ be the sequence of vertices visited by the agent. If there exists an index $i$ such that $v_i = J_2$ and $v_k \\neq A$ for all $k < i$, then the sub-path $(v_i, \\dots, A)$ leading to the first inspection of $A$ must not traverse $J_1$ if $J_1 \\in \\{v_0, \\dots, v_{i-1}\\}$.

The AI faculty have requested that their seminars be held only during the morning or midday slots, as they feel the afternoon is not the right time for those specific discussions. For the Biology track, we want to avoid clustering everything in one location; you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Biology seminars are distributed across at least two different rooms rather than being confined to just one.\n\nWe also have a physical restriction regarding our venue: Room 4 is completely unavailable during the midday slot on both days, so you\u2019ll need to leave that space empty during those times. The Mathematics department has its own set of rules as well. To ensure students can attend every session, no two Math seminars can ever happen at the same time, regardless of which rooms they are in.\n\nFinally, there are three specific seminars that require special attention. Seminar 5 must take place on the second day of the event, and because of the speaker's travel plans, it cannot be scheduled in the morning slot.

The layout of this network is quite specific: from our starting position at point 1, the drone can fly directly to either point 2 or point 3, but point 4 is a bit more isolated and can only be reached by traveling through point 2. Because of the way the navigation system is programmed, the drone is strictly limited to moving between these directly adjacent locations.\n\nThe mission objective is to ensure that both point 3 and point 4 are scanned during the flight, though the drone operator can decide which of those two targets to visit first. Timing is the most rigid part of this operation; the drone\u2019s flight path must last for exactly five time units. Since every single move from one point to the next consumes exactly one unit of time, the drone will need to make a total of five hops across the network. The mission begins at point 1, and the drone must navigate the connections efficiently enough to cover both required scan sites within that precise five-move window."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 4 Locations"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(1..4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Adjacent nodes: (1\u20132), (1\u20133), (2\u20134)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(1, 2).\nedge(1, 3).\nedge(2, 4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can only move between adjacent nodes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(Imagine, V) : loc(Imagine) } 1 :- time(V).\n:- at(V1, V), at(V11, V+1), not edge(V1, V11), not edge(V11, V1), time(V)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 5 timesteps"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit locations: 3, 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(3, _).\nat(4, _)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(1, 0)."}]}

To get everything organized, we have two time slots available throughout the day\u2014one in the morning and one in the afternoon\u2014and we\u2019ve been allocated three different rooms to use.\n\nThe main objective is to ensure that every single lecture is assigned to a room and a specific time slot without skipping any sessions or accidentally duplicating them. Naturally, we have to be careful about space, so each room can only host a maximum of one lecture per time slot to avoid any double-booking. \n\nThere is one specific restriction from the department that we have to follow closely regarding how we use the rooms. It turns out that Mathematics and Physics lectures are not permitted to take place in the same room at all. Even if a Math lecture is held in the morning and a Physics lecture is scheduled for the afternoon, they still cannot share the same physical space.

The primary mission objective is to conduct a thorough inspection of both OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once. While these two stops are mandatory, the rover also has the option to swing by the RelayStation to pick up bonus diagnostic data if the mission parameters allow for it.\n\nNavigating this environment requires careful management of both time and power. Every movement between adjacent locations takes exactly one minute and consumes one unit of the rover\u2019s limited six-unit battery. Furthermore, once the rover arrives at a destination, it must remain stationary for a full minute to complete its scanning sequence. The geography of the area is centered around two main junctions: BaseCamp connects directly to Fork1 and Fork2. From Fork1, the rover can reach either OutpostX or the RelayStation. Similarly, Fork2 provides a path to OutpostY as well as an alternate route to the RelayStation.\n\nThere is a specific incentive for efficiency regarding the optional RelayStation visit. The diagnostic reward offered there is only granted if the rover manages to complete both mandatory inspections at OutpostX and OutpostY while still having more than two units of battery power remaining in its reserves. Finally, the entire operation must be executed with precision, as the rover is required to complete its full route and all chosen tasks within a strict ten-minute window."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Locations: BaseCamp, Fork1, Fork2, OutpostX, OutpostY, RelayStation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"BaseCamp\"; \"Fork1\"; \"Fork2\"; \"OutpostX\"; \"OutpostY\"; \"RelayStation\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Edges"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"BaseCamp\", \"Fork1\").\nedge(\"BaseCamp\", \"Fork2\").\nedge(\"Fork1\", \"OutpostX\").\nedge(\"Fork1\", \"RelayStation\").\nedge(\"Fork2\", \"OutpostY\").\nedge(\"Fork2\", \"RelayStation\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: 10 Minutes maximum time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The rover starts at BaseCamp."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"BaseCamp\", 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Inspect OutpostX and OutpostY exactly once each."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { inspect_at(\"OutpostX\", T) : time(T) } 1.\n1 { inspect_at(\"OutpostY\", T) : time(T) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Moves between adjacent nodes takes 1 timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { at(L, T) : loc(L) } 1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2), not edge(L2, L1), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each inspection requires 1 full timestep at the inspection site."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L, T) :- inspect_at(L, T).\nat(L, T+1) :- inspect_at(L, T), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each movement consumes 1 battery unit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "move(L1, L2, T) :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), edge(L1, L2), L1 != L2.\nused_battery(N, T) :- N = #count { T1 : move(_, _, T1), T1 < T }, time(T)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The battery stores 6 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "remaining_battery(N1, T) :- used_battery(N2, T), N1 = 6 - N2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Only allow inspection of RelayStation if there are >2 battery units once the other sites are scanned."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0 { inspect_at(\"RelayStation\", T) : time(T) } 1.\n:- inspect_at(\"RelayStation\", _), remaining_battery(N, T), N <= 2, sites_scanned(T).\nsites_scanned(T) :- T = #max { T1 : inspect_at(L, T1), L != \"RelayStation\"}."}]}

Every movement between locations consumes exactly one minute of operation time. The AUV\u2019s journey begins with two possible exit vectors: Channel Alpha (requiring 2 units of fuel) or Channel Beta (requiring 3 units of fuel).\n\nOnce the AUV enters Channel Alpha, it can proceed directly to Station X, a move costing 2 fuel units. Conversely, Channel Beta provides a gateway to Station Y at a cost of 2 fuel units, while also offering a cross-current link to Channel Alpha for a 1-unit fuel expenditure. If the vehicle is at Station X, it may transition back to Channel Beta by spending 2 fuel units. From Station Y, the AUV can navigate to a central Relay Station, which carries a 3-unit fuel penalty. This Relay Station provides a single exit path to Station Z, costing an additional 2 fuel units. Finally, a long-distance return current exists from Station Z back to Station X, though this maneuver requires 4 fuel units due to heavy pressure resistance.\n\n**Operational Parameters:**\n*   **Temporal Costs:** While travel takes one minute per leg, conducting a sensor sweep at any station (X, Y, or Z) requires the AUV to remain docked and stationary for two consecutive minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The AUV must successfully complete a sensor sweep at both Station X and Station Y.\n*   **Time Criticality:** To capture specific tidal data, the sensor sweep at Station X must be finished no later than the 5-minute mark of the mission.\n*   **Optional Objectives:** A sweep of Station Z is encouraged but not required for mission success.\n*   **Endurance Limits:** The AUV\u2019s chassis and mission clock limit it to a maximum of 20 total actions (where each minute of travel or docking counts as one action).\n*   **Energy Constraints:** The AUV starts with a full energy reservoir of 14 units. Total fuel consumption across all movements cannot exceed this 14-unit ceiling.\n*   **Replenishment Protocol:** The AUV may opt to remain idle at the Relay Station for exactly two minutes to recover 4 units of fuel. However, if the AUV enters the Relay Station for any reason, it is forced by the prevailing currents to proceed to Station Z in the very next minute.\n*   **Optimization Hierarchy:** The primary goal is to maximize the total number of unique sensor sweeps performed. If two paths result in the same number of sweeps, the strategy that completes the mandatory sweeps (X and Y) in the shortest total time is preferred.\n*   **Sensor Safety:** To prevent equipment fatigue, the AUV is strictly forbidden from performing back-to-back sensor sweeps at the same station."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}]}

A set of temporal slots $T = \\{t_{morning}, t_{afternoon}\\}$.\n2.  A set of spatial venues $R = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n\n**Objective:**\nDefine a schedule as a mapping $f: S \\to T \\times R$ that assigns each session to a unique coordinate in the resource grid, subject to the following system of constraints:\n\n**1. Resource Exclusivity (Injectivity Constraint):**\nThe mapping $f$ must be injective. Specifically, for any two distinct sessions $s_i, s_j \\in S$:\n$$s_i \\neq s_j \\implies f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$$\nThis ensures that no two sessions occupy the same room during the same time slot. Given $|S| = |T \\times R|$, the mapping must be bijective.\n\n**2. Domain-Specific Temporal Constraints:**\nLet $proj_T$ be the projection of the schedule onto the temporal set $T$. For any session $s_i \\in S$:\n$$\\text{If } A(s_i) = \\text{Security}, \\text{ then } proj_T(f(s_i)) = t_{afternoon}$$\n\n**3.

CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### Exercise 4.12: The Multi-Dimensional Resource Allocation Problem\n\n**Problem Context:**\nConsider a scheduling optimization problem involving a set of ten seminars, denoted as $\\mathcal{S} = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{10}\\}$. Each seminar $s_i$ is categorized by a specific knowledge domain $T_i \\in \\{\\text{Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology, Mathematics}\\}$. The objective is to assign each seminar to a unique coordinate within a three-dimensional discrete space defined by:\n*   **Days:** $\\mathcal{D} = \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   **Time Slots:** $\\mathcal{P} = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ (representing morning, midday, and afternoon)\n*   **Rooms:** $\\mathcal{R} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\n\nLet the assignment function be defined as $f: \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathcal{D} \\times \\mathcal{P} \\times \\mathcal{R}$, where $f(s) = (d, p, r)$.\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe assignment must satisfy the following logical conditions:\n\n1.  **Injectivity (Resource Conflict):** No two seminars may occupy the same spatial-temporal coordinate. For any $s_i, s_j \\in \\mathcal{S}$, if $i \\neq j$, then $f(s_i) \\neq f(s_j)$.\n2.  **Domain-Specific Temporal Restriction (AI):** For all $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ where $T_s = \\text{AI}$, the assigned time slot $p$ must satisfy $p \\in \\{p_1, p_2\\}$. (Seminars in AI are excluded from afternoon slots).\n3.  **Spatial Dispersion (Biology):** Let $\\mathcal{S}_{Bio} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ be the subset of seminars focused on Biology. The set of rooms assigned to $\\mathcal{S}_{Bio}$ must have a cardinality $|\\{r \\mid \\exists s \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Bio}, f(s) = (d, p, r)\\}| \\geq 2$.\n4.  **Venue Exclusion:** The coordinate $(d, p_2, 4)$ is unavailable for all $d \\in \\mathcal{D}$. Room 4 is strictly prohibited for use during the midday slot on both days.\n5.  **Temporal Mutual Exclusion (Mathematics):** Let $\\mathcal{S}_{Math} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ be the subset of seminars focused on Mathematics. For any $s_i, s_j \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Math}$ where $i \\neq j$, the temporal components $(d_i, p_i)$ and $(d_j, p_j)$ must be distinct, regardless of the room assignment $r$.\n6.  **Specific Entity Constraints:**\n    *   **Seminar 5:** The assignment $f(s_5) = (d, p, r)$ must satisfy $d = 2$ and $p \\neq p_1$.\n    *   **Seminars 6 and 7:** Let $f(s_6) = (d_6, p_6, r_6)$ and $f(s_7) = (d_7, p_7, r_7)$. The assignments must satisfy $r_6 = r_7$ and $d_6 \\neq d_7$.\n\n**Task:**\n1.  Formulate this problem as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**, identifying the variables, domains, and formal algebraic constraints.\n2.  Determine if a valid schedule exists by evaluating the intersection of the constraints. \n3.
