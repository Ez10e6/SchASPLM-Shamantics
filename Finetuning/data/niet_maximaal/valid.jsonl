The robot\u2019s task is to navigate a small grid of five interconnected sites to drop off packages at two specific destinations: D and E. The map is designed such that the robot can only move between adjacent points that have a direct connection.

We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

To successfully complete its mission, the drone must visit and inspect both of these substations at least once. Every movement the drone makes between any two facilities consumes exactly one kilojoule of energy, and performing the actual inspection at each substation requires an additional kilojoule.\n\nThe industrial site is laid out such that Station1 is directly adjacent to two transit points: Junction1 and Junction2. If the drone travels through Junction1, it has direct access to SubstationA. Conversely, Junction2 provides the primary path to SubstationB. To allow for cross-site travel, a direct connection also exists between Junction1 and Junction2.\n\nWhile the drone is equipped with a total energy capacity of eight kilojoules, efficiency is our primary objective.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### **Exercise: Multi-Constraint Path Optimization in a Thermal-Temporal State Space**\n\n#### **1. System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor. Our task now is to find the specific combination of frame, motor, and battery that respects all these compatibility rules while pushing our total endurance score to the highest possible number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Frames: Lightweight (Endurance 50), Standard (Endurance 40), Reinforced (Endurance 30)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "frame(\"Lightweight\", 50; \"Standard\", 40; \"Reinforced\", 30)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Batteries: SmallCell (Endurance 30), MediumCell (Endurance 50), LongLife (Endurance 80)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "battery(\"SmallCell\", 30; \"MediumCell\", 50; \"LongLife\", 80)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Total endurance score"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_endurance(E) :-\nselected_frame(F), frame(F, EF),\nselected_motor(M), motor(M, EM),\nselected_battery(B), battery(B, EB),\nE = EF + EM + EB.\n#maximize { E : total_endurance(E) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: HighTorque requires LongLife battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_motor(\"HighTorque\"), selected_battery(B), B != \"LongLife\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: LongLife battery requires Reinforced frame"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"LongLife\"), selected_frame(F), F != \"Reinforced\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: SmallCell battery only works with Eco motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"SmallCell\"), selected_motor(M), M != \"Eco\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select one frame, one motor, one battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_frame(F) : frame(F, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_motor(M) : motor(M, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_battery(B) : battery(B, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Lightweight frame is incompatible with HighTorque motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_frame(\"Lightweight\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Motors: Eco (Endurance 60), Standard (Endurance 70), HighTorque (Endurance 90)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "motor(\"Eco\", 60; \"Standard\", 70; \"HighTorque\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: MediumCell battery supports only Eco or Standard motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"MediumCell\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}]}

You\u2019ll need to avoid scheduling anything\nthere during that time.\nTopic-specific requirements further shape the schedule.

The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.

As you know, we need to build a complete package that includes exactly one data plan, one specific phone model, and a single accessory.\n\nOur options for the data plans are pretty straightforward: we have either the BasicData or the PremiumData. For the hardware, the customer can choose between the ModelX and the ModelY. To finish it off, we need to include an accessory, which will be either CaseA or CaseB.\n\nHowever, there are a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. For starters, we can't offer the BasicData plan to anyone who picks the ModelY, as they just aren't compatible. Furthermore, the ModelX is designed with a very specific form factor, so if someone chooses that phone, they are required to take CaseA. The final complication is that our PremiumData plan has some interference issues with the materials in CaseA, so those two can never be paired together.\n\nAfter sitting down and mapping out the dependencies, I\u2019ve found a configuration that works perfectly without breaking any of these rules. We should set the customer up with the PremiumData plan, the ModelY phone, and CaseB.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nImagine we are sitting down to spec out a high-end gaming laptop for a client who wants the absolute best performance possible. We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor. Our task now is to find the specific combination of frame, motor, and battery that respects all these compatibility rules while pushing our total endurance score to the highest possible number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: frames lightweight endurance 50 standard endurance 40 reinforced endurance 30"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "frame(\"Lightweight\", 50; \"Standard\", 40; \"Reinforced\", 30)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: motors eco endurance 60 standard endurance 70 hightorque endurance 90"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "motor(\"Eco\", 60; \"Standard\", 70; \"HighTorque\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: batteries smallcell endurance 30 mediumcell endurance 50 longlife endurance 80"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "battery(\"SmallCell\", 30; \"MediumCell\", 50; \"LongLife\", 80)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select one frame one motor one battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_frame(F) : frame(F, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_motor(M) : motor(M, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_battery(B) : battery(B, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: hightorque requires longlife battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_motor(\"HighTorque\"), selected_battery(B), B != \"LongLife\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: lightweight frame is incompatible with hightorque motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_frame(\"Lightweight\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: longlife battery requires reinforced frame"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"LongLife\"), selected_frame(F), F != \"Reinforced\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: smallcell battery only works with eco motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"SmallCell\"), selected_motor(M), M != \"Eco\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: mediumcell battery supports only eco or standard motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"MediumCell\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: total endurance score"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_endurance(E) :-\nselected_frame(F), frame(F, EF),\nselected_motor(M), motor(M, EM),\nselected_battery(B), battery(B, EB),\nE = EF + EM + EB.\n#maximize { E : total_endurance(E) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### Exercise 4.2: Constrained Optimization in System Configuration\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nIn the design of a specialized workstation for data-intensive computational simulations, a systems architect must select a hardware configuration consisting of exactly one Central Processing Unit (CPU), one Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and one Storage Unit (SU). The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints.

The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4. Optimization Objective\nDefine an objective function to maximize the total room utilization $U$, where $U = \\sum_{d,t,r} \\mathbb{1}(x_{d,t,r} \\neq \\emptyset)$. The goal is to maximize $U$ subject to the constraints above, ensuring the highest possible density of sessions without violating the logical framework of the symposium.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### **Exercise: Multi-Constraint Path Optimization in a Thermal-Temporal State Space**\n\n#### **1. System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes subdock coralpass ventstream beaconalpha deeploop beaconbeta nodex beacongamma"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bidirectional edges  heat costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: heat tolerance max 10 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement takes 1\u202fmin heat increases per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulsing at beaconalpha  beaconbeta is mandatory beacongamma optional"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: beaconalpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulse beacongamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cooldown stop at nodex for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: when at nodex next action must be either pulse at nodex or cooldown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: action limit \u2264\u202f16 moves\u202f\u202fpulses\u202f\u202fcooldowns"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: must visit ventstream between each pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: objective minimise time in which not pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

The vertex set $V$ is defined as:\n$V = \\{\\text{CommandCenter (CC)}, \\text{PathA (PA)}, \\text{PathB (PB)}, \\text{TowerX (TX)}, \\text{TowerY (TY)}, \\text{MidRelay (MR)}, \\text{TowerZ (TZ)}\\}$.\n\n**Edge Weights and Transitions**\nEach directed edge $e \\in E$ is associated with an energy cost $c(e)$ and a uniform traversal time $\\Delta t = 1$ minute. The transitions are defined as follows:\n1. $(CC, PA): c=2$\n2. $(CC, PB): c=3$\n3. $(PA, TX): c=2$\n4. $(PB, TY): c=2$\n5. $(PB, PA): c=1$\n6. $(TX, PB): c=2$\n7. $(TY, MR): c=3$\n8. $(MR, TZ): c=2$\n9. $(TZ, TX): c=4$\n\n**Agent State and Operational Constraints**\nAn autonomous agent begins at $CC$ at $t=0$ with an initial energy capacity $E_{max} = 14$ units. The agent\u2019s state is subject to the following conditions:\n*   **Energy Constraint:** The cumulative energy expenditure must not exceed $E_{max}$. The energy level is capped at 14; any recovery exceeding this value is truncated.\n*   **Scanning Protocol:** At nodes $\\{TX, TY, TZ\\}$, the agent may perform a \"Scan\" action. A scan requires an uninterrupted duration of $\\Delta t_{scan} = 2$ minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The agent must complete at least one scan at both $TX$ and $TY$.\n*   **Temporal Constraint:** The scan at $TX$ must be completed (finalized) such that $t_{end} \\le 5$ minutes.\n*   **Sequence Constraints:**\n    1. If the agent enters $MR$, it may perform an \"Idle\" action for exactly 2 minutes to recover 4 energy units. \n    2. Any visit to $MR$ (with or without idling) mandates that the subsequent transition must be to $TZ$ in the following minute.\n    3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor. Our task now is to find the specific combination of frame, motor, and battery that respects all these compatibility rules while pushing our total endurance score to the highest possible number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Frames: Lightweight (Endurance 50), Standard (Endurance 40), Reinforced (Endurance 30)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "frame(\"Lightweight\", 50; \"Standard\", 40; \"Reinforced\", 30)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Motors: Eco (Endurance 60), Standard (Endurance 70), HighTorque (Endurance 90)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "motor(\"Eco\", 60; \"Standard\", 70; \"HighTorque\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: SmallCell battery only works with Eco motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"SmallCell\"), selected_motor(M), M != \"Eco\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: MediumCell battery supports only Eco or Standard motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"MediumCell\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: LongLife battery requires Reinforced frame"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"LongLife\"), selected_frame(F), F != \"Reinforced\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Batteries: SmallCell (Endurance 30), MediumCell (Endurance 50), LongLife (Endurance 80)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "battery(\"SmallCell\", 30; \"MediumCell\", 50; \"LongLife\", 80)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Lightweight frame is incompatible with HighTorque motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_frame(\"Lightweight\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select one frame, one motor, one battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_frame(F) : frame(F, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_motor(M) : motor(M, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_battery(B) : battery(B, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Total endurance score"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_endurance(E) :-\nselected_frame(F), frame(F, EF),\nselected_motor(M), motor(M, EM),\nselected_battery(B), battery(B, EB),\nE = EF + EM + EB.\n#maximize { E : total_endurance(E) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: HighTorque requires LongLife battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_motor(\"HighTorque\"), selected_battery(B), B != \"LongLife\"."}]}

The goal is to assemble a system using exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one motherboard. For the processor, we have a choice between a Ryzen5 or an i5, and for the graphics card, we can go with either a GTX1660 or an RX580. To tie it all together, we have two motherboard options: the B450 and the Z390.\n\nHowever, we have to navigate a few compatibility hurdles before we can finalize the parts list. If we decide to use the Ryzen5 CPU, it is only compatible with the B450 motherboard, meaning those two must stay together.

The transitions are defined as follows:\n1. $(CC, PA): c=2$\n2. $(CC, PB): c=3$\n3. $(PA, TX): c=2$\n4. $(PB, TY): c=2$\n5. $(PB, PA): c=1$\n6. $(TX, PB): c=2$\n7. $(TY, MR): c=3$\n8. $(MR, TZ): c=2$\n9. $(TZ, TX): c=4$\n\n**Agent State and Operational Constraints**\nAn autonomous agent begins at $CC$ at $t=0$ with an initial energy capacity $E_{max} = 14$ units. The agent\u2019s state is subject to the following conditions:\n*   **Energy Constraint:** The cumulative energy expenditure must not exceed $E_{max}$. The energy level is capped at 14; any recovery exceeding this value is truncated.\n*   **Scanning Protocol:** At nodes $\\{TX, TY, TZ\\}$, the agent may perform a \"Scan\" action. A scan requires an uninterrupted duration of $\\Delta t_{scan} = 2$ minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The agent must complete at least one scan at both $TX$ and $TY$.\n*   **Temporal Constraint:** The scan at $TX$ must be completed (finalized) such that $t_{end} \\le 5$ minutes.\n*   **Sequence Constraints:**\n    1. If the agent enters $MR$, it may perform an \"Idle\" action for exactly 2 minutes to recover 4 energy units. \n    2. Any visit to $MR$ (with or without idling) mandates that the subsequent transition must be to $TZ$ in the following minute.\n    3.

We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor. Our task now is to find the specific combination of frame, motor, and battery that respects all these compatibility rules while pushing our total endurance score to the highest possible number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Frames: Lightweight (Endurance 50), Standard (Endurance 40), Reinforced (Endurance 30)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "frame(\"Lightweight\", 50; \"Standard\", 40; \"Reinforced\", 30)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Motors: Eco (Endurance 60), Standard (Endurance 70), HighTorque (Endurance 90)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "motor(\"Eco\", 60; \"Standard\", 70; \"HighTorque\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Batteries: SmallCell (Endurance 30), MediumCell (Endurance 50), LongLife (Endurance 80)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "battery(\"SmallCell\", 30; \"MediumCell\", 50; \"LongLife\", 80)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select one frame, one motor, one battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_frame(Lightweight) : frame(Lightweight, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_motor(D) : motor(D, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_battery(V4) : battery(V4, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: HighTorque requires LongLife battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_motor(\"HighTorque\"), selected_battery(Q), Q != \"LongLife\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Lightweight frame is incompatible with HighTorque motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_frame(\"Lightweight\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: LongLife battery requires Reinforced frame"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"LongLife\"), selected_frame(V5), V5 != \"Reinforced\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: SmallCell battery only works with Eco motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"SmallCell\"), selected_motor(E), E != \"Eco\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: MediumCell battery supports only Eco or Standard motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"MediumCell\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Total endurance score"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_endurance(V8) :-\nselected_frame(Lightweight), frame(Lightweight, H),\nselected_motor(Finally), motor(Finally, Eco),\nselected_battery(X), battery(X, D),\nV8 = H + Eco + D.\n#maximize { V8 : total_endurance(V8) }."}]}

The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4.

To successfully complete its mission, the drone must visit and inspect both of these substations at least once. Every movement the drone makes between any two facilities consumes exactly one kilojoule of energy, and performing the actual inspection at each substation requires an additional kilojoule.\n\nThe industrial site is laid out such that Station1 is directly adjacent to two transit points: Junction1 and Junction2. If the drone travels through Junction1, it has direct access to SubstationA. Conversely, Junction2 provides the primary path to SubstationB. To allow for cross-site travel, a direct connection also exists between Junction1 and Junction2.\n\nWhile the drone is equipped with a total energy capacity of eight kilojoules, efficiency is our primary objective.

The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4. Optimization Objective\nDefine an objective function to maximize the total room utilization $U$, where $U = \\sum_{d,t,r} \\mathbb{1}(x_{d,t,r} \\neq \\emptyset)$. The goal is to maximize $U$ subject to the constraints above, ensuring the highest possible density of sessions without violating the logical framework of the symposium.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

In addition, AI and Biology\nworkshops must not share a room on the same day.

We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

As you know, we need to build a complete package that includes exactly one data plan, one specific phone model, and a single accessory.\n\nOur options for the data plans are pretty straightforward: we have either the BasicData or the PremiumData. For the hardware, the customer can choose between the ModelX and the ModelY. To finish it off, we need to include an accessory, which will be either CaseA or CaseB.\n\nHowever, there are a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. For starters, we can't offer the BasicData plan to anyone who picks the ModelY, as they just aren't compatible. Furthermore, the ModelX is designed with a very specific form factor, so if someone chooses that phone, they are required to take CaseA. The final complication is that our PremiumData plan has some interference issues with the materials in CaseA, so those two can never be paired together.\n\nAfter sitting down and mapping out the dependencies, I\u2019ve found a configuration that works perfectly without breaking any of these rules. We should set the customer up with the PremiumData plan, the ModelY phone, and CaseB. This combination satisfies everything: by choosing the ModelY, we avoid the BasicData conflict, and since we aren't using the ModelX, we aren't forced into using CaseA.

We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n**Exercise: Constrained Optimization in Symposium Scheduling**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a scheduling problem for a three-day academic symposium. The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4. Optimization Objective\nDefine an objective function to maximize the total room utilization $U$, where $U = \\sum_{d,t,r} \\mathbb{1}(x_{d,t,r} \\neq \\emptyset)$. The goal is to maximize $U$ subject to the constraints above, ensuring the highest possible density of sessions without violating the logical framework of the symposium.\n\n**Task:**\n1.  Formulate the integer programming model for this scheduling problem.\n2.  Determine if a feasible solution exists that accommodates all twelve workshops while adhering to the temporal separation and room homogeneity constraints.\n3.

As you know, we need to build a complete package that includes exactly one data plan, one specific phone model, and a single accessory.\n\nOur options for the data plans are pretty straightforward: we have either the BasicData or the PremiumData. For the hardware, the customer can choose between the ModelX and the ModelY. To finish it off, we need to include an accessory, which will be either CaseA or CaseB.\n\nHowever, there are a few compatibility issues we have to navigate. For starters, we can't offer the BasicData plan to anyone who picks the ModelY, as they just aren't compatible. Furthermore, the ModelX is designed with a very specific form factor, so if someone chooses that phone, they are required to take CaseA. The final complication is that our PremiumData plan has some interference issues with the materials in CaseA, so those two can never be paired together.\n\nAfter sitting down and mapping out the dependencies, I\u2019ve found a configuration that works perfectly without breaking any of these rules. We should set the customer up with the PremiumData plan, the ModelY phone, and CaseB. This combination satisfies everything: by choosing the ModelY, we avoid the BasicData conflict, and since we aren't using the ModelX, we aren't forced into using CaseA.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe\u2019re finally getting the green light to assemble that new workstation for our AI research, but there\u2019s a catch: we have to keep the hardware costs as low as humanly possible while ensuring every single part is compatible. We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard.

The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating.

However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70.

To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe.

We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor.

Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2.

Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited.

We need to select one processor, one graphics card, one motherboard, and a power supply unit to get the rig up and running.\n\nFor the brains of the operation, we\u2019re looking at three processors. The Ryzen7 is the budget-friendly choice at 300, but it strictly requires the X670 motherboard. Then there\u2019s the i9 for 400, though we have to remember it is incompatible with that same X670 board. Finally, we have the server-grade Xeon for 500, but if we go that route, it must be installed in the C621 workstation-class motherboard. Speaking of motherboards, the X670 is the cheapest at 180, followed by the Z690 at 200, and the C621 at 250.\n\nThe graphics card is where things get a bit more complicated for the budget. We could go with the RTX4060 for 350, the beefier RTX3090 for 700, or the high-end Quadro for 800. If we decide on the Quadro, we are forced to use the Xeon CPU, and we also have to make sure we don't try to pair that Quadro with a Z690 motherboard. Another thing to keep in mind is that both the RTX3090 and the Quadro consume a massive amount of power.\n\nThis brings us to our power supply options: Bronze for 80, Gold for 120, and Platinum for 160. Because they are so power-hungry, neither the RTX3090 nor the Quadro can operate with the Bronze PSU; we\u2019d have to step up to at least the Gold or Platinum level for those cards. \n\nOur goal is to navigate all these technical requirements to find the specific combination of components that results in the lowest total price tag.

However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture.

System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited.

The objective is to assign a set of twelve distinct workshops, $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}\\}$, representing four discrete disciplines, $S = \\{\\text{AI, Physics, Mathematics, Linguistics}\\}$, to a spatio-temporal grid. The grid is defined by the Cartesian product of Days $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$, Time Slots $T = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3\\}$ (Morning, Midday, Evening), and Rooms $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n\nLet $x_{d,t,r} \\in S \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ be a decision variable representing the discipline assigned to a specific room-time slot. The schedule must satisfy the following system of constraints:\n\n### 1. Spatial and Temporal Allocation Constraints\n*   **Workshop Coverage:** Each workshop $w \\in W$ must be allocated to at least one slot $(d, t, r)$.\n*   **Occupancy Limit:** Each room $r \\in R$ may host a maximum of two workshops per day $d \\in D$.\n*   **Temporal Separation:** For any room $r$ on day $d$, consecutive time slots $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ cannot both be occupied. A minimum of one vacant slot must separate any two sessions in the same room.\n*   **Room Availability:** Room $r_2$ is unavailable during all evening slots $t_3$. Formally, $x_{d,t_3,r_2} = \\emptyset$ for all $d$.\n*   **Capacity Constraints:** Room $r_4$ is prohibited from hosting workshops in the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Physics.\n\n### 2. Discipline-Specific Constraints\n*   **AI Temporal Restriction:** AI workshops must be scheduled exclusively during morning sessions ($t_1$).\n*   **Physics Temporal Restriction:** Physics workshops are restricted to $d_1$ and $d_2$; they may not be scheduled on $d_3$.\n*   **Mathematics Spatial Restriction:** Mathematics workshops must be assigned exclusively to $r_1$ or $r_3$.\n*   **Linguistics Concurrency:** Linguistics workshops are subject to a non-concurrency constraint. For any $(d, t)$, there exists at most one $r$ such that $x_{d,t,r} = \\text{Linguistics}$.\n\n### 3. Homogeneity and Diversity Requirements\n*   **Daily Room Homogeneity:** Each room $r$ on day $d$ must be dedicated to exactly one discipline $s \\in S$ for all sessions occurring in that room on that day.\n*   **Daily Discipline Breadth:** For every day $d \\in D$, the schedule must include at least one workshop from each of the four disciplines $s \\in S$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   The initial session of the symposium $(d_1, t_1)$ must include at least one AI workshop.\n    *   The terminal session of the symposium $(d_3, t_3)$ must include at least one Linguistics workshop.\n\n### 4. Optimization Objective\nDefine an objective function to maximize the total room utilization $U$, where $U = \\sum_{d,t,r} \\mathbb{1}(x_{d,t,r} \\neq \\emptyset)$. The goal is to maximize $U$ subject to the constraints above, ensuring the highest possible density of sessions without violating the logical framework of the symposium.\n\n**Task:**\n1.

We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture.

The vertex set $V$ is defined as:\n$V = \\{\\text{CommandCenter (CC)}, \\text{PathA (PA)}, \\text{PathB (PB)}, \\text{TowerX (TX)}, \\text{TowerY (TY)}, \\text{MidRelay (MR)}, \\text{TowerZ (TZ)}\\}$.\n\n**Edge Weights and Transitions**\nEach directed edge $e \\in E$ is associated with an energy cost $c(e)$ and a uniform traversal time $\\Delta t = 1$ minute. The transitions are defined as follows:\n1. $(CC, PA): c=2$\n2. $(CC, PB): c=3$\n3. $(PA, TX): c=2$\n4. $(PB, TY): c=2$\n5. $(PB, PA): c=1$\n6. $(TX, PB): c=2$\n7. $(TY, MR): c=3$\n8. $(MR, TZ): c=2$\n9. $(TZ, TX): c=4$\n\n**Agent State and Operational Constraints**\nAn autonomous agent begins at $CC$ at $t=0$ with an initial energy capacity $E_{max} = 14$ units. The agent\u2019s state is subject to the following conditions:\n*   **Energy Constraint:** The cumulative energy expenditure must not exceed $E_{max}$. The energy level is capped at 14; any recovery exceeding this value is truncated.\n*   **Scanning Protocol:** At nodes $\\{TX, TY, TZ\\}$, the agent may perform a \"Scan\" action. A scan requires an uninterrupted duration of $\\Delta t_{scan} = 2$ minutes.\n*   **Mandatory Objectives:** The agent must complete at least one scan at both $TX$ and $TY$.\n*   **Temporal Constraint:** The scan at $TX$ must be completed (finalized) such that $t_{end} \\le 5$ minutes.\n*   **Sequence Constraints:**\n    1. If the agent enters $MR$, it may perform an \"Idle\" action for exactly 2 minutes to recover 4 energy units. \n    2. Any visit to $MR$ (with or without idling) mandates that the subsequent transition must be to $TZ$ in the following minute.\n    3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur mobile inspection drone is currently stationed at the main hub, Station1, and is tasked with surveying two key areas: SubstationA and SubstationB. To successfully complete its mission, the drone must visit and inspect both of these substations at least once. Every movement the drone makes between any two facilities consumes exactly one kilojoule of energy, and performing the actual inspection at each substation requires an additional kilojoule.\n\nThe industrial site is laid out such that Station1 is directly adjacent to two transit points: Junction1 and Junction2. If the drone travels through Junction1, it has direct access to SubstationA. Conversely, Junction2 provides the primary path to SubstationB. To allow for cross-site travel, a direct connection also exists between Junction1 and Junction2.\n\nWhile the drone is equipped with a total energy capacity of eight kilojoules, efficiency is our primary objective.
