Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites.

The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations.
