The event spans two full days, and each\nday is divided into three time slots: morning, midday, and afternoon.\nYou have access to three rooms where these workshops can be held.\nEvery workshop must be placed somewhere in the schedule \u2014 that is,\nassigned to at least one session at a specific room and a specific time on\none of the two days.\nNo two workshops can occupy the same room at the same time, and each\nroom is limited to a maximum of two workshops per day. So, on any\ngiven day, each room will have at least one unused time slot.\nHowever, one of the rooms comes with a constraint: Room 2 is unavailable\nin the afternoon, on both days. You\u2019ll need to avoid scheduling anything\nthere during that time.\nTopic-specific requirements further shape the schedule. AI workshops must\nalways be held in the morning, so they cannot be scheduled at midday or\nin the afternoon. Math workshops must not overlap with each other in\ntime, meaning that no two math sessions can occur simultaneously\n \u2014 even if they\u2019re in different rooms. In addition, AI and Biology\nworkshops must not share a room on the same day. If an AI session\ntakes place in a given room on a given day, then no Biology session\ncan be placed in that room on that day, and vice versa.\nFinally, to ensure balanced subject coverage, each day must include at\nleast one workshop from each topic \u2014 AI, Math, and Bio \u2014 so no subject\nis omitted from a day\u2019s agenda.\nWhen choosing among valid schedules, it\u2019s preferable to use space\nefficiently: try to fill as many available slots as possible while\nrespecting all the constraints.

Both days are sliced into four\nsegments \u2014 morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon \u2014 and\nyou have five distinct rooms at your disposal.\nNaturally, every seminar must find its place in the programme, and no room ever\nhosts more than one talk at once. To keep the flow manageable and give each\nroom a little breathing room, no room may be booked for more than half of the \ntime slots in a single day, nor may it run back\u2011to\u2011back sessions without a break.\nAlso, bear in mind that Room\u202f3 goes offline once afternoon begins,\nand Room\u202f5 lacks any projection equipment, so any seminar requiring slides\nwon\u2019t fit there.\nSpeaking of equipment, both AI and Mathematics talks rely on a working projector,\nand the AI presentations have an early\u2011day preference: they\u2019re confined to the\nmorning or late\u2011morning slots. Biology seminars, by contrast, must be sprinkled\nacross the two days \u2014 never exclusively in one \u2014 and you cannot have two bio talks\ntaking place simultaneously. Chemistry talks, on the other hand, are social\nin time but solitary in space: no two of them may ever occupy the same\nroom. Additionally, you can\u2019t mix a Bio session with a Chem\nsession under the same roof on a given day, so those pairings must stay apart.\nThere\u2019s also a special framing requirement: the symposium must open and close\nwith mathematics, so the very first seminar and the final seminar of are both\nmathematics events. Beyond that, you\u2019ll want to avoid empty slots\nunless there\u2019s simply no alternative. Each time segment should showcase as\nmany different topics as possible, and while it\u2019s fine for Biology and Chemistry\nto overlap with other sessions, no more than two Bio\u2011or\u2011Chem seminars may ever\nrun at the same moment.\nWith these guidelines in mind, you\u2019ll blend room capacities, projector access, \ntemporal preferences, and topic distributions into a single, seamless schedule \nthat serves presenters, attendees, and the venues\u2019 technical quirks without leaving\nunnecessary gaps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: There are 10 research seminars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "seminar(1..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Seminars are on AI, Bio, Math, or Chem"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "topic(\"AI\";

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous rover is tasked with collecting critical samples in a subterranean Mars base tunnel network. The mission\nbegins at the LaunchPad with the rover's water tank fully filled to 16 liters, which serves as both coolant and\nhydraulic fluid for its drilling operations. The rover must navigate through a series of interconnected tunnels and \nstations within a strict 10-minute timeframe.\nFrom the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed through either Tunnel1 or Tunnel2, requiring 2 and 3 liters of water \nrespectively due to varying cooling needs across different thermal gradients. Tunnel1 leads to StationA, consuming \nan additional 1 liter to operate in the station's climate. After completing operations at StationA, the rover can \nmove through Tunnel3 (1 liter) to reach Tunnel2. Alternatively, from the LaunchPad, the rover can proceed directly \nto Tunnel2, which branches to either StationB (1 liter) or CalibEdge (2 liters). CalibEdge connects to StationC \n(1 liter), which in turn provides a route back to Tunnel1 (2 liters), completing a potential circuit.\nThe rover must collect samples at StationA and StationB exactly once each, with StationA's samples having a \ntime-sensitive composition that degrades rapidly\u2014requiring collection no later than minute 6. There is also a \npotential third collection site at StationC, which contains valuable but non-essential samples. These must samples must \nbe taken if and only if the other locations are sampled within the first 8 minutes. The mission parameters dictate \nthat StationC must be sampled if and only if both primary stations are sampled by minute 8.\nEach sampling operation requires the rover to remain stationary for precisely one minute, during which its advanced \nfiltration system actually recovers 1 liter of water from the mineral-rich substrates. However, no two consecutive \nsamples can be taken at the same station due to cross-contamination protocols.\nThe CalibEdge location houses an emergency water reservoir with filtration capabilities. By spending two consecutive \nminutes at this location, the rover can replenish 3 liters of water to its tank, though this reservoir can only be \naccessed once during the mission due to facility lockdown protocols.\nMovement between any two connected locations takes exactly one minute, and the rover can only traverse along the \ndesignated tunnel system in the specified directions. The mission controller has imposed a strict limit of 18 total \nevents\u2014including movements, sampling operations, and water refills\u2014to minimize wear on the rover's mechanisms.\nThe primary mission objective is to maximize the number of samples collected across all stations.

The event unfolds over four days, and each day is\nstructured into four distinct sessions: early morning, late morning, early\nafternoon, and late afternoon. A total of five rooms are available throughout\nthe event.\nEach of the ten presentations must be scheduled \u2014 no omissions \u2014 and\nonly one presentation can take place in a unique room-time pairing. A room can host\nno more than three presentations per day, and its use must be non-consecutive,\nmeaning you can\u2019t assign it to back-to-back sessions.\nThe schedule must avoid this kind of compression for all rooms.\nThere are several equipment and room-specific limitations to consider. Room 2 lacks\na projector, so it cannot be used for topics that require one \u2014 namely, AI and Cloud\npresentations. Meanwhile, VR sessions are not permitted in Room 1 at all, regardless\nof the time or day.\nTopical and temporal separation also plays a role in the schedule design. IoT\npresentations must be distributed across at least three different days, so they\ncan\u2019t be grouped too tightly. There is a strict spatial constraint that forbids\nAI and VR from being scheduled in the same room on the same day \u2014 those topics\nmust not share a physical space within any single day, even at different times.\nYou\u2019ll also need to control how much simultaneous activity occurs among closely\nrelated topics. Cloud and IoT are allowed to overlap with each other, but not\nexcessively: no more than two such presentations may occur during the\nsame time slot, regardless of room.\nA few time-critical constraints must be obeyed.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert AI researcher. Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Clingo ASP code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous drone is deployed from the CommandCenter to conduct a high-priority\nsurveillance operation across a network of facilities connected by directional flight\ncorridors. Each corridor imposes a specific energy toll based on its interference\nshielding, altitude, and weather-exposure classification, and all traversals take\none minute of flight time. From the CommandCenter, the drone can initiate its route\nvia either the eastern or western outbound lanes\u2014PathA and PathB\u2014requiring 2 and 3 \nattery units respectively due to differing elevation profiles.\nOnce on PathA, a route leads directly to TowerX, whose uplink requires a further 2 \nnits of battery to approach. PathB, while more power-intensive to enter, allows access\nto TowerY at a moderate 2-unit cost and also provides a lateral link back to PathA at\njust 1 battery unit. If needed, the drone may later pivot from TowerX back to PathB,\nthough doing so consumes 2 battery units. Continuing from TowerY, the drone may\nproceed to a transmission relay node (MidRelay), incurring a 3-unit toll through the\nrestricted airspace corridor. MidRelay provides one-way access to TowerZ, which lies\ndeeper within the perimeter and requires 2 additional battery units to reach. \nTowerZ also offers a long-range return path to TowerX, but this high-bandwidth jump\nimposes a significant 4-unit power penalty due to interference shielding and altitude\ngain.\nThe mission begins at time zero.\nWhile movement between locations always takes one minute, scanning any tower requires\nthe drone to remain stationary for two uninterrupted minutes to ensure signal\nacquisition and image stabilization. The drone must complete at least one successful\nscan at both TowerX and TowerY. Due to temporal sensitivity in the data collection\nprotocol, the scan of TowerX must be finalized no later than minute 5. TowerZ is\nconsidered an auxiliary objective that may be scanned, but is not required to be.\nThe drone is permitted no more than 20 total stops, including all\nscanning and travel actions. It begins the mission with a fully charged battery,\ncapped at 14 units of available power. The aggregate energy cost of the drone\u2019s\nmovements must not exceed this capacity.\nTo accommodate potential mid-mission power depletion, the drone is allowed to idle\nat MidRelay for exactly two consecutive minutes to restore 4 battery units; however,\nthis recovery interrupts the route and consumes valuable time. If the drone ever\nvisits MidRelay during the mission, it must reach TowerZ immediately in the following\nminute due to routing constraints and signal lock-on requirements.\nFor mission planning, the primary optimization goal is to maximize the total number\nof tower scans conducted, including any optional sites. If multiple strategies yield\nthe same number of scans, preference is given to the one that completes a scan at each \nmandatory scan location in the fewest minutes. Operational protocols also prohibit\nconsecutive scans at the same location to prevent data redundancy and sensor overheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: CommandCenter, PathA, PathB, TowerX, TowerY, MidRelay, TowerZ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"CommandCenter\"; \"PathA\"; \"PathB\"; \"TowerX\"; \"TowerY\"; \"MidRelay\"; \"TowerZ\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Directed Edges and Movement Costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathA\",2).\nedge(\"CommandCenter\",\"PathB\",3).\nedge(\"PathA\",\"TowerX\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"TowerY\",2).\nedge(\"PathB\",\"PathA\",1).\nedge(\"TowerX\",\"PathB\",2).\nedge(\"TowerY\",\"MidRelay\",3).\nedge(\"MidRelay\",\"TowerZ\",2).\nedge(\"TowerZ\",\"TowerX\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone starts at CommandCenter at time 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(\"CommandCenter\",0).\ntime(0..10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement between adjacent nodes takes 1 minute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), L1 != L2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 full minutes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T) :- scan_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 10.\nat(L,T+2) :- scan_at(L,T), T < 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone must scan TowerX and TowerY at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1{ scan_at(\"TowerX\", T): time(T) }.\n1{ scan_at(\"TowerY\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerX must be scanned by time 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not scan_at(\"TowerX\",T): time(T), T < 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: TowerZ can be scanned optionally."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ scan_at(\"TowerZ\", T): time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The total number of location visits must not exceed 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- N = #count {L,T: at(L,T)}, N > 20."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone has a maximum battery capacity of 14 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "used_batt(T+1 ,B2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), used_batt(T,B1), B2 = B1 + Cost.\nused_batt(T+1, B) :- at(L,T), at(L,T+1), used_batt(T, B).\nused_batt(0, 0).\n:- used_batt(_, B), B > 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: If the drone visits MidRelay, then it must be at TowerZ in the next timestep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"MidRelay\",T), not at(\"TowerZ\",T+1), T < 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximise the number of scans performed"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "#maximize { 1@2 : scan_at(L,T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: As a secondary priority minimize the time by which all sites are scanned at least once"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "scanned_time(T) :- T = #min{T1: scan_at(\"TowerX\", T2), scan_at(\"TowerY\", T3), T1>=T2, T1>=T3, time(T1) }.\n#minimize { T@1 : scanned_time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone cannot perform two consecutive scans at the same location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- scan_at(L,T1), scan_at(L,T2), T2 = T1 + 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The drone can recharge 4 battery units by spending 2 minutes idle at MidRelay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recharge(T) :- at(\"MidRelay\",T), at(\"MidRelay\",T+1), at(\"MidRelay\",T+2), T < 9.\nused_batt(T+1,Bnew) :- recharge(T), used_batt(T,B), Bnew = B-4."}]}
