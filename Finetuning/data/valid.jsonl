Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250. Consider that a soft constraint, they'll\nreject your build if that balance is off.\nAlso, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you\u2019re not\nallowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement\nnotes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn\u2019t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS\nissues.
