Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but we need to make sure the final configuration respects every one of these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Components: CPUs = {X9, ZetaCore, Alpha8}, GPUs = {QuasarRTX, NovaX, GammaGTX},Storage = {UltraSSD, MegaHDD, FusionDrive}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one storage device."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: FusionDrive can only be used with ZetaCore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Costs: [UltraSSD: 250, MegaHDD: 200, FusionDrive: 300]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Performance: [X9: 95, ZetaCore: 120, Alpha8: 110]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Costs: [X9: 300, ZetaCore: 500, Alpha8: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The selected GPU must not have higher performance than the selected CPU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Costs: [QuasarRTX: 700, NovaX: 600, GammaGTX: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Performance: [UltraSSD: 100, MegaHDD: 60, FusionDrive: 95]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Alpha8 is incompatible with NovaX."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: You may not select all three top-performing components."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Performance: [QuasarRTX: 130, NovaX: 125, GammaGTX: 90]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}]}

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds.

Consider that a soft constraint, they'll\nreject your build if that balance is off.\nAlso, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you\u2019re not\nallowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement\nnotes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn\u2019t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS\nissues.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize \"wasted\" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}]}

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor.

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile. When choosing between valid routes, the primary objective is to minimize \"inactive time\"\u2014defined as any time spent on transits or cooldowns rather than on acoustic calibrations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes subdock coralpass ventstream beaconalpha deeploop beaconbeta nodex beacongamma"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bidirectional edges  heat costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: heat tolerance max 10 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement takes 1\u202fmin heat increases per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulsing at beaconalpha  beaconbeta is mandatory beacongamma optional"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: beaconalpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulse beacongamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cooldown stop at nodex for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: when at nodex next action must be either pulse at nodex or cooldown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: action limit \u2264\u202f16 moves\u202f\u202fpulses\u202f\u202fcooldowns"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: must visit ventstream between each pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: objective minimise time in which not pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture. Our job is to find the perfect mix of these parts that yields the highest total score while respecting every one of these hardware requirements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPUs: Ryzen9 (performance 95), i7 (performance 85), M1 (performance 70)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"Ryzen9\", 95; \"i7\", 85; \"M1\", 70)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPUs: RTX3070 (performance 90), RX6700XT (performance 88), IrisXe (performance 65)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "gpu(\"RTX3070\", 90; \"RX6700XT\", 88; \"IrisXe\", 65)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Coolers: AirCool (performance 20), LiquidCool (performance 40), PassiveCool (performance 5)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooler(\"AirCool\", 20; \"LiquidCool\", 40; \"PassiveCool\", 5)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Each configuration selects one CPU, one GPU, one cooler."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_cooler(C) : cooler(C, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: High-performance parts: Ryzen9, RTX3070."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "high_perf(\"Ryzen9\").\nhigh_perf(\"RTX3070\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: LiquidCool is required for high-performance parts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), high_perf(C), selected_cooler(K), K != \"LiquidCool\".\n:- selected_gpu(G), high_perf(G), selected_cooler(K), K != \"LiquidCool\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: PassiveCool is not allowed with discrete GPUs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "discrete_gpu(\"RTX3070\"; \"RX6700XT\").\n:- selected_gpu(G), discrete_gpu(G), selected_cooler(\"PassiveCool\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: RX6700XT incompatible with M1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_gpu(\"RX6700XT\"), selected_cpu(\"M1\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Maximize total performance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_perf(P) :-\nselected_cpu(C), cpu(C, P1),\nselected_gpu(G), gpu(G, P2),\nselected_cooler(K), cooler(K, P3),\nP = P1 + P2 + P3.\n#maximize { P : total_perf(P) }."}]}

We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### **Exercise: Multi-Constraint Path Optimization in a Thermal-Temporal State Space**\n\n#### **1. System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}]}

Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}]}

These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but we need to make sure the final configuration respects every one of these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: components cpus  x9 zetacore alpha8 gpus  quasarrtx novax gammagtxstorage  ultrassd megahdd fusiondrive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select exactly one cpu one gpu and one storage device"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu costs x9 300 zetacore 500 alpha8 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu costs quasarrtx 700 novax 600 gammagtx 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage costs ultrassd 250 megahdd 200 fusiondrive 300"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu performance x9 95 zetacore 120 alpha8 110"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu performance quasarrtx 130 novax 125 gammagtx 90"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage performance ultrassd 100 megahdd 60 fusiondrive 95"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: you may not select all three topperforming components"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the selected gpu must not have higher performance than the selected cpu"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: alpha8 is incompatible with novax"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: fusiondrive can only be used with zetacore"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}]}

Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize \"wasted\" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nI was just reviewing the procurement notes for the new simulation workstations, and it looks like we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands. We need to select exactly one processor, one graphics card, and one storage unit from the approved list, but the office has some specific rules about how we balance cost and performance.\n\nFor the processors, we\u2019re looking at the X9, which is a moderate choice with a performance score of 95 for $300. If we want more power, there\u2019s the Alpha8 at a score of 110 for $450, or the top-of-the-line ZetaCore, which hits a score of 120 but costs $500. Our graphics card options are similarly tiered: the QuasarRTX is the powerhouse with 130 points at $700, followed by the NovaX with 125 points at $600, and finally the GammaGTX, which offers 90 points for $450. To finish the build, we have three storage choices: the UltraSSD with a score of 100 for $250, the FusionDrive with 95 points for $300, and the budget MegaHDD, which scores 60 points and costs $200.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the internal guidelines. First off, IT leadership insists that whichever component in your final selection is the most expensive must also be the one that has the highest performance score of the three. However, they don\u2019t want us just picking the absolute best-rated item from every single category; they\u2019ve explicitly stated we cannot choose the highest-performing part from all three classes at once. There is also a strict requirement for financial balance: no single component in your build can cost more than $250 more than any other component in that same build, or procurement will reject the request.\n\nOn the technical side, there\u2019s a bottleneck rule stating that the graphics card\u2019s performance score is not allowed to exceed the performance score of the processor. We also have some compatibility headaches to keep in mind. The Alpha8 CPU has known BIOS issues and cannot be paired with the NovaX GPU. Furthermore, the procurement notes mention that the FusionDrive is only available for selection if you are also using the ZetaCore processor. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but we need to make sure the final configuration respects every one of these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Components: CPUs = {X9, ZetaCore, Alpha8}, GPUs = {QuasarRTX, NovaX, GammaGTX},Storage = {UltraSSD, MegaHDD, FusionDrive}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one storage device."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Costs: [X9: 300, ZetaCore: 500, Alpha8: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Costs: [QuasarRTX: 700, NovaX: 600, GammaGTX: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Costs: [UltraSSD: 250, MegaHDD: 200, FusionDrive: 300]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Performance: [X9: 95, ZetaCore: 120, Alpha8: 110]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Performance: [QuasarRTX: 130, NovaX: 125, GammaGTX: 90]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Performance: [UltraSSD: 100, MegaHDD: 60, FusionDrive: 95]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: You may not select all three top-performing components."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The selected GPU must not have higher performance than the selected CPU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Alpha8 is incompatible with NovaX."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: FusionDrive can only be used with ZetaCore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}]}

System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe are finally at the stage where we need to finalize the configuration for our new delivery drone, and the main objective is to maximize the total flight endurance score. We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind.

The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Formulate the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).\n2.  Provide a step-by-step elimination of invalid configurations based on the constraints provided.\n3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nWhen preparing a workstation tailored for data-intensive simulations, you\u2019re expected to\nselect a processor, a graphics card, and a storage unit from a shortlist provided by the\nprocurement office. Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them.

We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture.

We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind.

We have three main components to select: the frame, the motor, and the battery. Each choice carries a different endurance value, but we have to be careful because several hardware limitations dictate which parts can actually work together.\n\nStarting with the frames, the Lightweight frame is the most efficient with an endurance score of 50, followed by the Standard frame at 40, and the Reinforced frame at 30. For the motors, the HighTorque model offers the highest performance at 90 points, while the Standard motor sits at 70 and the Eco motor at 60. Finally, our battery options include the LongLife cell at 80 points, the MediumCell at 50, and the SmallCell at 30.\n\nThe tricky part is navigating the physical and electrical constraints of the build. For example, while the Lightweight frame is great for endurance, it simply isn't sturdy enough to handle the HighTorque motor. Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### **Exercise: Multi-Constraint Path Optimization in a Thermal-Temporal State Space**\n\n#### **1. System Formalization**\nLet the undersea environment be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents a set of nodes and $E$ represents bidirectional traversal lanes. Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ is associated with a thermal cost $w(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The state of a marine survey drone at any time $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is defined by the tuple $S_t = (v_t, h_t, P_t, \\text{last\\_vst})$, where:\n*   $v_t \\in V$ is the current node.\n*   $h_t \\in [0, 10]$ is the accumulated thermal load.\n*   $P_t \\subseteq \\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$ is the set of completed acoustic pulses.\n*   $\\text{last\\_vst}$ is a boolean flag indicating if the node `VentStream` has been visited since the last pulse.\n\n#### **2. Topology and Edge Weights**\nThe graph $G$ consists of the following nodes and weighted edges:\n*   **Nodes:** $V = \\{\\text{SubDock (SD)}, \\text{CoralPass (CP)}, \\text{VentStream (VS)}, \\text{BeaconAlpha (BA)}, \\text{BeaconBeta (BB)}, \\text{NodeX (NX)}, \\text{BeaconGamma (BG)}, \\text{DeepLoop (DL)}\\}$.\n*   **Edges and Weights (Heat Units):**\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{CP}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{SD}, \\text{VS}) = 4$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{BA}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{CP}, \\text{DL}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{DL}, \\text{VS}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{BB}) = 2$\n    *   $(\\text{VS}, \\text{NX}) = 1$\n    *   $(\\text{NX}, \\text{BG}) = 3$\n    *   $(\\text{BG}, \\text{BA}) = 4$\n\n#### **3. Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Nodes: SubDock, CoralPass, VentStream, BeaconAlpha, DeepLoop, BeaconBeta, NodeX, BeaconGamma."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Bidirectional Edges & Heat Costs:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Heat Tolerance: max 10 units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, V15), V15 > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Movement takes 1\u202fmin, heat increases per edge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(H, State): loc(H) }1 :- time(State).\n:- at(Let, State), at(V11, State+1), not edge(Let, V11, _), not edge(V11, Let, _), Let != V11.\nheat(State+1,S) :- at(Let,State), at(V11,State+1), edge(Let,V11,V), heat(State,V15), S=V15+V."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(Y,Nodes)        :- pulse_at(Y,Nodes).\nat(Y,Nodes+1)      :- pulse_at(Y,Nodes), Nodes < 15.\nheat(Nodes+2,Acoustic+1)   :- pulse_at(_,Nodes), heat(Nodes,Acoustic), Nodes < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulsing at BeaconAlpha & BeaconBeta is mandatory, BeaconGamma optional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",M) : time(M) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", M) : time(M) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: BeaconAlpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",V5): time(V5), V5<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Pulse BeaconGamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",Let), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",Multi), max(Let,Multi) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Cooldown: stop at NodeX for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(Multi) :- at(\"NodeX\",Multi), at(\"NodeX\",Multi+1), Multi < 15.\nheat(Multi+2,0) :- cooldown(Multi), Multi < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: When at NodeX next action must be either pulse at NodeX or cooldown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",Operational), Operational < 15, not cooldown(Operational), not pulse_at(_,Operational+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Action Limit: \u2264\u202f16 (moves\u202f+\u202fpulses\u202f+\u202fcooldowns)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(Pulses)   :- at(Identify, Pulses), at(B, Pulses+1), Identify != B.\naction(Pulses)   :- pulse_at(_,Pulses).\naction(Pulses) :- cooldown(Pulses).\n:- #count {Multi : action(Multi)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Must visit VentStream between each pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(Edges, Objectives) :-  at(\"VentStream\",Operational), Edges < Operational < Objectives, time(Edges), time(Objectives).\n:- pulse_at(_,Upon), pulse_at(_,Mandatory), not vent_between(Upon, Mandatory), Upon < Mandatory."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Objective: minimise time in which not pulsing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(V10) :- time(V10), not pulse_at(_,V10).\nnon_pulses(P) :- P = #count{ V10: non_pulse(V10) }.\n#minimize { P: non_pulses(P) }."}]}

The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Formulate the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).\n2.  Provide a step-by-step elimination of invalid configurations based on the constraints provided.\n3.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nAn autonomous submersible departs from its primary Launch Bay into a network of undersea corridors. These corridors form a bidirectional graph where every transit takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of thermal stress to the unit\u2019s systems. The submersible has a maximum thermal threshold of 10 units. It can fully purge its accumulated heat by remaining stationary for two minutes within a cooling pocket located at the NodeX junction.\n\nFrom the Launch Bay, the unit can navigate via the Low-Pressure Reef (2 units) or the High-Pressure Trench (4 units). The Low-Pressure Reef provides access to Pylon Alpha (1 unit) or the Circulatory Bypass (1 unit). The Circulatory Bypass connects back to the High-Pressure Trench. From the High-Pressure Trench, the submersible can travel directly to Pylon Beta (2 units) or the NodeX junction (1 unit). NodeX acts as a gateway to Pylon Gamma (3 units). Finally, a high-velocity current links Pylon Gamma back to Pylon Alpha (4 units).\n\nAt each Pylon, the unit must perform an acoustic calibration. Each calibration requires two minutes to complete and increases the system's thermal stress by 1 unit. Calibrations at Pylon Alpha and Pylon Beta are mandatory. The calibration at Pylon Alpha must be completed before the mission clock reaches 5 minutes. A calibration at Pylon Gamma is optional; however, it must be performed if and only if both mandatory calibrations are finished within the first 8 minutes of the mission.\n\nThe mission is limited to a maximum of 16 total actions (where an action is a move, a calibration, or a cooldown). If the unit enters the NodeX junction, it must either perform an immediate calibration there or undergo a cooldown before departing. To prevent signal interference, the unit is forbidden from performing consecutive calibrations without first transiting through the High-Pressure Trench to reset its signal profile.

The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Formulate the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).\n2.  Provide a step-by-step elimination of invalid configurations based on the constraints provided.\n3.

CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5.

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nOur survey drone is about to deploy from the SubDock into a complex network of bidirectional undersea currents, and there are several operational parameters we need to keep in mind for this mission. Rather than tracking battery life, we are monitoring the drone\u2019s internal temperature; it has a maximum heat tolerance of 10 units. Every movement the drone makes between locations takes exactly one minute and adds a specific amount of heat to its systems. If the drone needs to reset its thermal levels, it can shed all accumulated heat by lingering in the cool-water eddy at NodeX for two consecutive minutes.\n\nThe geography of the site offers a few different paths. Upon leaving the SubDock, the drone can navigate either the gentle CoralPass, which adds 2 heat units, or the more turbulent VentStream, which adds 4. From the CoralPass, the drone can reach Beacon Alpha for 1 heat unit or take the DeepLoop for 1 unit, which hooks back into the VentStream. The VentStream itself provides direct access to Beacon Beta for 2 heat units or to the NodeX sensor hub for 1 unit. From NodeX, a branch leads to Beacon Gamma for 3 heat units, and Beacon Gamma is also connected back to Beacon Alpha via a high-intensity, 4-unit down-draft conduit.\n\nThe core of our mission involves performing acoustic pulses at the various beacons for data calibration. Each pulse takes two minutes to complete and adds 1 unit of heat to the drone. We are required to pulse at Beacon Alpha and Beacon Beta. Timing is tight for the first leg: Beacon Alpha must be pulsed before the clock hits the five-minute mark. Beacon Gamma is an optional target, but we should only pulse there if both mandatory pulses at Alpha and Beta are successfully completed within the first eight minutes of the mission.\n\nWe have a strict limit of 16 total actions\u2014which includes every move, every pulse, and every cooldown period\u2014before the drone must conclude its run. Furthermore, we have specific safety protocols at the sensor hub; if the drone enters NodeX, it must either perform an immediate pulse there or undergo a cooldown before it is allowed to move to another location. To prevent signal overlap, we are forbidden from performing consecutive pulses without returning to the VentStream to reconfigure the drone\u2019s systems between them. As you plan the route, remember that our primary objective is to minimize \"wasted\" time, ensuring the drone spends as little time as possible on activities other than its actual survey pulses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes subdock coralpass ventstream beaconalpha deeploop beaconbeta nodex beacongamma"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bidirectional edges  heat costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: heat tolerance max 10 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement takes 1\u202fmin heat increases per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulsing at beaconalpha  beaconbeta is mandatory beacongamma optional"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: beaconalpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulse beacongamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cooldown stop at nodex for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: when at nodex next action must be either pulse at nodex or cooldown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: action limit \u2264\u202f16 moves\u202f\u202fpulses\u202f\u202fcooldowns"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: must visit ventstream between each pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: objective minimise time in which not pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints. If multiple solutions exist, determine which configuration yields the highest aggregate performance $\\sum P$.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Formulate the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).\n2.  Provide a step-by-step elimination of invalid configurations based on the constraints provided.\n3.

CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap.

CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration.

BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on.

Operational Constraints**\nThe drone\u2019s trajectory is subject to the following logical and physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal Mechanics:** Every movement (traversal of an edge) consumes exactly $\\Delta t = 1$ time unit.\n2.  **Acoustic Pulses:** At nodes $\\text{BA}$, $\\text{BB}$, and $\\text{BG}$, the drone may perform a pulse.\n    *   A pulse consumes $\\Delta t = 2$ and increases heat load by $\\Delta h = 1$.\n    *   **Signal Overlap Constraint:** Consecutive pulses are prohibited. A pulse at any location must be followed by a visit to node `VS` before another pulse can be initiated.\n3.  **Thermal Management:**\n    *   $h_t$ must never exceed the maximum capacity $H_{max} = 10$.\n    *   **Cooldown:** At node $\\text{NX}$, the drone may perform a cooldown action. This requires $\\Delta t = 2$ and resets $h_t$ to $0$.\n    *   **Forced Action:** Upon entering node $\\text{NX}$, the drone is restricted: it must either perform an acoustic pulse (if at a survey site) or a cooldown before exiting.\n4.  **Mission Objectives and Deadlines:**\n    *   **Mandatory Pulses:** Pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are required.\n    *   **Temporal Hard Constraint:** The pulse at $\\text{BA}$ must be completed such that $t_{end} < 5$.\n    *   **Conditional Pulse:** A pulse at $\\text{BG}$ is required *if and only if* the mandatory pulses at $\\text{BA}$ and $\\text{BB}$ are both completed by $t \\le 8$.\n5.  **Termination:** The mission must conclude within a total action budget of $N \\le 16$, where an action is defined as a move, a pulse, or a cooldown.\n\n#### **4. Optimization Goal**\nDefine a path that satisfies all constraints while minimizing **Latency** ($L$), where $L$ is defined as the total time $T$ spent in non-pulse actions (i.e., minimizing the drone's \"idle\" or traversal time relative to its calibration duties).\n\n---\n\n### **Task for the Student:**\n1.  **State-Space Search:** Construct a state-transition diagram or a search tree starting from $S_0 = (\\text{SD}, 0, \\emptyset, \\text{True})$.\n2.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine if a valid sequence of actions exists that satisfies the conditional requirement for $\\text{BeaconGamma}$.\n3.  **Path Identification:** Identify the optimal sequence of nodes and actions that minimizes the latency $L$. \n4.  **Constraint Verification:** Explicitly demonstrate that the thermal load $h_t$ never violates the threshold $H_{max}$ and that the \"Signal Overlap\" rule is maintained via the `VS` node."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: nodes subdock coralpass ventstream beaconalpha deeploop beaconbeta nodex beacongamma"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "loc(\"SubDock\"; \"CoralPass\"; \"VentStream\"; \"BeaconAlpha\"; \"DeepLoop\"; \"BeaconBeta\"; \"NodeX\"; \"BeaconGamma\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: bidirectional edges  heat costs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "edge(\"SubDock\",\"CoralPass\",2).\nedge(\"SubDock\",\"VentStream\",4).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"BeaconAlpha\",1).\nedge(\"CoralPass\",\"DeepLoop\",1).\nedge(\"DeepLoop\",\"VentStream\",1).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"BeaconBeta\",2).\nedge(\"VentStream\",\"NodeX\",1).\nedge(\"NodeX\",\"BeaconGamma\",3).\nedge(\"BeaconGamma\",\"BeaconAlpha\",4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: heat tolerance max 10 units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heat(0,0).\n:- heat(_, H), H > 10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: movement takes 1\u202fmin heat increases per edge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "time(0..15).\n1{ at(L, T): loc(L) }1 :- time(T).\n:- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), not edge(L1, L2, _), not edge(L2, L1, _), L1 != L2.\nheat(T+1,H2) :- at(L1,T), at(L2,T+1), edge(L1,L2,Cost), heat(T,H1), H2=H1+Cost."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: scans take 2 minutes and increase heat by 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "at(L,T)        :- pulse_at(L,T).\nat(L,T+1)      :- pulse_at(L,T), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,H+1)   :- pulse_at(_,T), heat(T,H), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulsing at beaconalpha  beaconbeta is mandatory beacongamma optional"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T) : time(T) }.\n1 { pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\", T) : time(T) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: beaconalpha must be pulsed by time\u202f5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- not pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",T): time(T), T<5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: pulse beacongamma iff mandatory pulses finish by minute\u202f8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mand_done :- pulse_at(\"BeaconAlpha\",TA), pulse_at(\"BeaconBeta\",TB), max(TA,TB) <= 8.\n:- pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_), not mand_done.\n:- mand_done, not pulse_at(\"BeaconGamma\",_)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cooldown stop at nodex for 2\u202fmin and reduce heat to 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cooldown(T) :- at(\"NodeX\",T), at(\"NodeX\",T+1), T < 15.\nheat(T+2,0) :- cooldown(T), T < 14."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: when at nodex next action must be either pulse at nodex or cooldown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- at(\"NodeX\",T), T < 15, not cooldown(T), not pulse_at(_,T+1)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: action limit \u2264\u202f16 moves\u202f\u202fpulses\u202f\u202fcooldowns"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "action(T)   :- at(L1, T), at(L2, T+1), L1 != L2.\naction(T)   :- pulse_at(_,T).\naction(T) :- cooldown(T).\n:- #count {A : action(A)} > 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: must visit ventstream between each pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vent_between(L, H) :-  at(\"VentStream\",T), L < T < H, time(L), time(H).\n:- pulse_at(_,T1), pulse_at(_,T2), not vent_between(T1, T2), T1 < T2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: objective minimise time in which not pulsing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "non_pulse(T) :- time(T), not pulse_at(_,T).\nnon_pulses(N) :- N = #count{ T: non_pulse(T) }.\n#minimize { N: non_pulses(N) }."}]}

Translate the following problem description into syntactically correct Answer Set Programming (ASP) code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\n### Exercise 4.2: Constrained Optimization in System Configuration\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nIn the design of a specialized workstation for data-intensive computational simulations, a systems architect must select a hardware configuration consisting of exactly one Central Processing Unit (CPU), one Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and one Storage Unit (SU). The selection is restricted to a predefined catalog provided by procurement. Each component $i$ is characterized by a cost $C_i$ and a performance rating $P_i$.\n\n**Table 1: Hardware Component Specifications**\n\n| Category | Entity Name | Performance ($P$) | Cost ($C$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **CPU** | X9 | 95 | $300 |\n| | ZetaCore | 120 | $500 |\n| | Alpha8 | 110 | $450 |\n| **GPU** | QuasarRTX | 130 | $700 |\n| | NovaX | 125 | $600 |\n| | GammaGTX | 90 | $450 |\n| **Storage** | UltraSSD | 100 | $250 |\n| | FusionDrive | 95 | $300 |\n| | MegaHDD | 60 | $200 |\n\n**Constraints:**\nLet $c \\in \\text{CPU}$, $g \\in \\text{GPU}$, and $s \\in \\text{Storage}$ represent the selected entities. A valid configuration must satisfy the following logical and arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **Cost-Performance Justification:** The component possessing the maximum cost within the configuration must also possess the maximum performance rating. Formally, if $x \\in \\{c, g, s\\}$ such that $C_x = \\max(C_c, C_g, C_s)$, then $P_x = \\max(P_c, P_g, P_s)$.\n2.  **Global Maxima Exclusion:** The configuration is prohibited from simultaneously selecting the highest-rated performance component from every category. \n3.  **Budgetary Variance Constraint:** To ensure component parity, the absolute difference in cost between any two selected components must not exceed $250. Formally, $\\forall i, j \\in \\{c, g, s\\}, |C_i - C_j| \\le 250$.\n4.  **Processing Hierarchy:** The performance rating of the GPU must not exceed the performance rating of the CPU ($P_g \\le P_c$).\n5.  **Inter-Component Compatibility:**\n    *   The CPU 'Alpha8' is incompatible with the GPU 'NovaX' due to firmware limitations.\n    *   The Storage Unit 'FusionDrive' may only be selected if the 'ZetaCore' CPU is also selected.\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify all valid triplets $(c, g, s)$ that satisfy the aforementioned constraints.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250. Consider that a soft constraint, they'll\nreject your build if that balance is off.\nAlso, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you\u2019re not\nallowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement\nnotes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn\u2019t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS\nissues. And for some reason, the FusionDrive isn\u2019t available unless you\u2019re pairing it\nwith the ZetaCore.\nDespite the abundance of high-performance hardware, you\u2019ll need to select carefully to\nstay within these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Components: CPUs = {X9, ZetaCore, Alpha8}, GPUs = {QuasarRTX, NovaX, GammaGTX},Storage = {UltraSSD, MegaHDD, FusionDrive}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Costs: [UltraSSD: 250, MegaHDD: 200, FusionDrive: 300]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Performance: [QuasarRTX: 130, NovaX: 125, GammaGTX: 90]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Performance: [X9: 95, ZetaCore: 120, Alpha8: 110]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Costs: [X9: 300, ZetaCore: 500, Alpha8: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: You may not select all three top-performing components."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: FusionDrive can only be used with ZetaCore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one storage device."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Performance: [UltraSSD: 100, MegaHDD: 60, FusionDrive: 95]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Costs: [QuasarRTX: 700, NovaX: 600, GammaGTX: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The selected GPU must not have higher performance than the selected CPU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Alpha8 is incompatible with NovaX."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}]}

We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250. Consider that a soft constraint, they'll\nreject your build if that balance is off.\nAlso, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you\u2019re not\nallowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement\nnotes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn\u2019t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS\nissues. And for some reason, the FusionDrive isn\u2019t available unless you\u2019re pairing it\nwith the ZetaCore.\nDespite the abundance of high-performance hardware, you\u2019ll need to select carefully to\nstay within these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: components cpus  x9 zetacore alpha8 gpus  quasarrtx novax gammagtxstorage  ultrassd megahdd fusiondrive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: select exactly one cpu one gpu and one storage device"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu costs x9 300 zetacore 500 alpha8 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu costs quasarrtx 700 novax 600 gammagtx 450"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage costs ultrassd 250 megahdd 200 fusiondrive 300"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: cpu performance x9 95 zetacore 120 alpha8 110"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: gpu performance quasarrtx 130 novax 125 gammagtx 90"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: storage performance ultrassd 100 megahdd 60 fusiondrive 95"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: you may not select all three topperforming components"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: the selected gpu must not have higher performance than the selected cpu"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: alpha8 is incompatible with novax"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: fusiondrive can only be used with zetacore"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}]}

Each configuration is defined as an ordered triple $(f, m, b)$ such that $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $m \\in \\mathcal{M}$, and $b \\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nThe primary objective is to maximize the **Total Flight Endurance Score** ($E$), defined as the scalar sum of the endurance coefficients associated with each selected component:\n$$E(f, m, b) = v(f) + v(m) + v(b)$$\n\n**Available Components and Associated Values:**\n1.  **Frames ($\\mathcal{F}$):** $\\mathcal{F} = \\{\\text{Lightweight } (f_1), \\text{Standard } (f_2), \\text{Reinforced } (f_3)\\}$\n    *   $v(f_1) = 50, v(f_2) = 40, v(f_3) = 30$\n2.  **Motors ($\\mathcal{M}$):** $\\mathcal{M} = \\{\\text{Eco } (m_1), \\text{Standard } (m_2), \\text{HighTorque } (m_3)\\}$\n    *   $v(m_1) = 60, v(m_2) = 70, v(m_3) = 90$\n3.  **Batteries ($\\mathcal{B}$):** $\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\text{SmallCell } (b_1), \\text{MediumCell } (b_2), \\text{LongLife } (b_3)\\}$\n    *   $v(b_1) = 30, v(b_2) = 50, v(b_3) = 80$\n\n**System Constraints:**\nThe selection of components is subject to the following logical predicates and structural dependencies:\n*   **C1 (Mechanical Integrity):** The selection of $f_1$ precludes the selection of $m_3$. \n    $$(f = f_1) \\implies (m \\neq m_3)$$\n*   **C2 (Structural Requirement):** The selection of $b_3$ necessitates the selection of $f_3$.\n    $$(b = b_3) \\implies (f = f_3)$$\n*   **C3 (Power Demand):** The selection of $m_3$ necessitates the selection of $b_3$.\n    $$(m = m_3) \\implies (b = b_3)$$\n*   **C4 (Voltage Compatibility I):** The selection of $b_1$ restricts the propulsion system to $m_1$.\n    $$(b = b_1) \\implies (m = m_1)$$\n*   **C5 (Voltage Compatibility II):** The selection of $b_2$ restricts the propulsion system to the subset $\\{m_1, m_2\\}$.\n    $$(b = b_2) \\implies (m \\in \\{m_1, m_2\\})$$\n\n**Tasks:**\n1.  **Formulate** the problem as a constrained optimization search space.\n2.  **Identify** all feasible configurations $(f, m, b)$ that satisfy the full set of constraints $\\{C1, C2, C3, C4, C5\\}$.\n3.  **Determine** the optimal configuration $(f^*, m^*, b^*)$ that yields the maximum value for $E$.\n4.  **Justify** why higher-performing individual components (e.g., $f_1$) might be excluded from the global optimum due to the propagation of constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Frames: Lightweight (Endurance 50), Standard (Endurance 40), Reinforced (Endurance 30)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "frame(\"Lightweight\", 50; \"Standard\", 40; \"Reinforced\", 30)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: LongLife battery requires Reinforced frame"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"LongLife\"), selected_frame(F), F != \"Reinforced\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Batteries: SmallCell (Endurance 30), MediumCell (Endurance 50), LongLife (Endurance 80)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "battery(\"SmallCell\", 30; \"MediumCell\", 50; \"LongLife\", 80)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: HighTorque requires LongLife battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_motor(\"HighTorque\"), selected_battery(B), B != \"LongLife\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Total endurance score"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "total_endurance(E) :-\nselected_frame(F), frame(F, EF),\nselected_motor(M), motor(M, EM),\nselected_battery(B), battery(B, EB),\nE = EF + EM + EB.\n#maximize { E : total_endurance(E) }."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Motors: Eco (Endurance 60), Standard (Endurance 70), HighTorque (Endurance 90)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "motor(\"Eco\", 60; \"Standard\", 70; \"HighTorque\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: MediumCell battery supports only Eco or Standard motor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"MediumCell\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select one frame, one motor, one battery"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_frame(F) : frame(F, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_motor(M) : motor(M, _) } 1.\n1 { selected_battery(B) : battery(B, _) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Lightweight frame is incompatible with HighTorque motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_frame(\"Lightweight\"), selected_motor(\"HighTorque\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: SmallCell battery only works with Eco motor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_battery(\"SmallCell\"), selected_motor(M), M != \"Eco\"."}]}

Furthermore, if we decide to use the LongLife battery, we are strictly required to use the Reinforced frame to support the extra weight. This choice is also linked to our motor selection because the HighTorque motor draws a massive amount of power; consequently, it cannot be used unless it is paired with that same LongLife battery. \n\nWe also have to keep the lower-capacity batteries in mind. The SmallCell battery is quite limited and can only provide enough power to run the Eco motor. If we step up to the MediumCell battery, we gain a little more flexibility, as it is compatible with either the Eco or the Standard motor.

We have to choose one CPU, one GPU, and one cooling system, and our goal is to maximize the combined performance score of all three components. However, there are some technical limitations and thermal constraints we have to navigate to make sure the machine actually functions.\n\nFor the processor, we have three choices: the heavy-hitting Ryzen9 with a performance score of 95, the reliable i7 at 85, and the efficient M1 at 70. On the graphics side, we can pick between the RTX3070, which leads the pack with a score of 90, the RX6700XT at 88, or the integrated IrisXe at 65. To keep everything running, we need to select a cooling method: LiquidCool offers the most performance boost at 40 points, AirCool sits in the middle at 20, and PassiveCool provides a modest 5 points.\n\nThe challenge lies in the compatibility rules. First, if we decide to go with the most powerful components\u2014specifically the Ryzen9 or the RTX3070\u2014the thermal output is so high that we are required to use LiquidCool. We also have to be mindful of the PassiveCool system; it just isn't strong enough to support discrete GPUs like the RTX3070 or the RX6700XT, so it can only be paired with the integrated IrisXe. While the M1 chip is efficient enough to work with PassiveCooling, we have to remember that the RX6700XT is completely incompatible with the M1 architecture.
