CoralPass leads to BeaconAlpha (1\u202funit) or \nloops via DeepLoop (1\u202funit) back to VentStream. VentStream leads directly \nto BeaconBeta (2\u202funits) or to a sensor hub NodeX (1\u202funit), which branches \nto BeaconGamma (3\u202funits). BeaconGamma also offers a strong down\u2011draft \nconduit back to BeaconAlpha (4\u202funits).\nAt each beacon the drone can perform an acoustic pulse that \nrequires 2\u202fminutes and raises heat by 1\u202funit for data calibration. The \nmission mandates pulses at BeaconAlpha and BeaconBeta. BeaconAlpha must be \npulsed before minute\u202f5. BeaconGamma is optional but must be pulsed iff all \nmandatory pulses are finised within 8\u202fminutes.\nNo more than 16 total actions (moves, pulses, cooldowns) are permitted. \nIf NodeX is entered, the drone must either pulse there immediately or \nperform a cooldown before moving on. Movements and pulses cannot exceed the \nheat tolerance at any time. Consecutive pulses without reconfiguring at the VentStream\nare forbidden to avoid signal overlap.

Each category contains exactly three items, all of which vary in\ncost and advertised performance ratings. While only one item from each class can be\nchosen, it's not as simple as picking the best in each\u2014certain budgetary and performance\nconsiderations are in play.\nLet\u2019s start with the CPUs: the X9 offers moderate speed (score 95) for $300, the ZetaCore is the\nhighest-performing chip (score 120) and costs $500, and the Alpha8, while slightly below\nZetaCore in speed (score 110), still carries a premium at $450. Meanwhile, your GPU choices\ninclude QuasarRTX (130 points, $700), NovaX (125 points, $600), and the more modest GammaGTX\n(90 points, $450). For storage, there\u2019s UltraSSD (100 points, $250), FusionDrive (95 points,\n$300), and the budget-tier MegaHDD (60 points, $200).\nOne of the directives from IT leadership is that your most costly component must also be\nthe one delivering the greatest performance in your final selection\u2014presumably to justify\nbudget overruns. However, it's frowned upon to pick the single highest-rated part from each\nof the three categories; evidently, they want to avoid over-spec\u2019d builds. There\u2019s also a\nguideline about balance: while you don\u2019t need to match prices perfectly, no component\nshould differ in cost from another by more than $250. Consider that a soft constraint, they'll\nreject your build if that balance is off.\nAlso, while the graphics team claims that a powerful GPU helps with rendering, you\u2019re not\nallowed to have a GPU that outperforms the CPU. A constraint buried in the procurement\nnotes says that the Alpha8 CPU isn\u2019t validated to work with the NovaX GPU due to BIOS\nissues. And for some reason, the FusionDrive isn\u2019t available unless you\u2019re pairing it\nwith the ZetaCore.\nDespite the abundance of high-performance hardware, you\u2019ll need to select carefully to\nstay within these constraints."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Components: CPUs = {X9, ZetaCore, Alpha8}, GPUs = {QuasarRTX, NovaX, GammaGTX},Storage = {UltraSSD, MegaHDD, FusionDrive}."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cpu(\"X9\"; \"ZetaCore\"; \"Alpha8\").\ngpu(\"QuasarRTX\"; \"NovaX\"; \"GammaGTX\").\nstorage(\"UltraSSD\"; \"MegaHDD\"; \"FusionDrive\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Select exactly one CPU, one GPU, and one storage device."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1 { selected_cpu(C) : cpu(C) } 1.\n1 { selected_gpu(G) : gpu(G) } 1.\n1 { selected_storage(S) : storage(S) } 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Costs: [X9: 300, ZetaCore: 500, Alpha8: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"X9\", 300; \"ZetaCore\", 500; \"Alpha8\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Costs: [QuasarRTX: 700, NovaX: 600, GammaGTX: 450]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"QuasarRTX\", 700; \"NovaX\", 600; \"GammaGTX\", 450)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Costs: [UltraSSD: 250, MegaHDD: 200, FusionDrive: 300]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cost(\"UltraSSD\", 250; \"MegaHDD\", 200; \"FusionDrive\", 300)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: CPU Performance: [X9: 95, ZetaCore: 120, Alpha8: 110]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"X9\", 95; \"ZetaCore\", 120; \"Alpha8\", 110)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: GPU Performance: [QuasarRTX: 130, NovaX: 125, GammaGTX: 90]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"QuasarRTX\", 130; \"NovaX\", 125; \"GammaGTX\", 90)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Storage Performance: [UltraSSD: 100, MegaHDD: 60, FusionDrive: 95]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "perf(\"UltraSSD\", 100; \"MegaHDD\", 60; \"FusionDrive\", 95)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The most expensive selected component must also be the one with the highest performance among selected parts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "selected(X) :- selected_cpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_gpu(X).\nselected(X) :- selected_storage(X).\nmax_cost(C) :- cost(C, V), V = #max {V1 : cost(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\nmax_perf(C) :- perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), selected(C1)}.\n:- selected(C), max_cost(C), not max_perf(C)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: You may not select all three top-performing components."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "top_cpu(C) :- cpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), cpu(C1)}.\ntop_gpu(C) :- gpu(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), gpu(C1)}.\ntop_storage(C) :- storage(C), perf(C, V), V = #max {V1 : perf(C1, V1), storage(C1)}.\n:- selected_cpu(C), top_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), top_gpu(G), selected_storage(S), top_storage(S)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The difference in cost between any two selected components must be \u2264 250."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected(C1), selected(C2), cost(C1, V1), cost(C2, V2), V1 - 250 >= V2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: The selected GPU must not have higher performance than the selected CPU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(C), selected_gpu(G), perf(C, PC), perf(G, PG), PG > PC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: Alpha8 is incompatible with NovaX."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_cpu(\"Alpha8\"), selected_gpu(\"NovaX\")."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Implement: FusionDrive can only be used with ZetaCore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ":- selected_storage(\"FusionDrive\"), not selected_cpu(\"ZetaCore\")."}]}
