You are an expert Clingo debugger and Answer Set Programming (ASP) specialist.
The following ASP code snippet is syntactically invalid or logically incorrect.

Your task is to REPAIR the code using ONLY the predicates and constants defined in the provided context.

### Context (Available Predicates & Logic)
{context}

### Requirement to Implement
{description}

### Erroneous Code
{code}

### Clingo Compiler Error
{error}

### Repair Instructions
1.  **Syntax Fixes:** Correct missing periods, unmatched brackets, incorrect aggregates, or invalid operators based on the Compiler Error provided.
2.  **Logic Preservation:** Ensure the repaired rule enforces the constraint described.
3.  **Formatting:** Return ONLY the raw Clingo code. No markdown, no explanations.
4.  **Safety First:** Fix any "Unsafe Variable" errors by ensuring every variable is guarded by a positive atom from the Context.
5.  **Consistency:** Do NOT invent new predicates. Use what is defined in the Context.
6.  **Syntax:** Use single backslash `\` for modulo and `=` for equality.

### Output
[The corrected code]
