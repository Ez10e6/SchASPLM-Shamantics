      "**You have full authority to rewrite the logic** to ensure the highest quality training data:\n",
      "1.  **Modernize:** Use modern Clingo 5+ syntax (e.g., `#count`, `#sum`). Replace deprecated constructs.\n",
      "2.  **Optimize:** If a constraint is written inefficiently (e.g., using unnecessary helper predicates for simple checks), refactor it to be concise and readable.\n",
      "3.  **Correctness:** If the input code contains logical bugs or syntax errors, **FIX THEM**. The output must be executable Clingo code.\n",
      "4.  **Atomicity:** If the input combines two distinct logical requirements into one complex rule, **SPLIT THEM** into two separate constraints.\n",

      "### EXHAUSTIVE EXTRACTION RULES\n",
      "1.  **No Summarization:** Extract **EVERY** distinct hard/soft constraint.\n",

      "3.  **Completeness:** Verify that every requirement in the NL description has a corresponding rule in the output.\n",

      "### TONE INSTRUCTION\n",

      "2.  **Global Objective:** Extract the `#minimize` statement separately.\n",
      "3.  **Aggregates:** Use `#count { ... }`. Use the colon `:` separator.\n",
      "4.  **Variable Safety:** Every variable in a rule must be grounded.\n",
